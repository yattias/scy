Assignment to design a CO2-friendly house
At this point you have the opportunity to design your CO2-friendly house. Based on the expertise you gained while working in expert groups, try to design a house by reducing its total carbon footprint as much as possible. 

For this purpose, use the Experimental Design Tool to identify the factors that influence the carbon emissions of your house. You can also use the SCYSIM to estimate the quantity of energy and CO2 that you can conserve by making various choices in your house’s design. 

As you conduct various activities to prepare your final design, you can keep a record of the choices you make in order to reduce carbon emissions. 

You can investigate factors such as:

1.total useable surface of the house
2.number of inhabitants
3.structure and insulation of walls, roof, and floor
4.type of doors, windows
5.air flow as determined by the ventilation system
6.units of power (watt) at which each appliance operates
7.energy supply 

As soon as you investigate the effect of each afore mentioned factor on energy consumption and CO2 emissions, prepare a short report summarizing your conclusions.
