Global warming 2
Thousands of scientists across the world observed that there is strong evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. Scientists have developed sophisticated simulations involving climate models as they attempt to accurately predict how the Earth’s climate will change in the next century. Every year the countries of the developed world emit millions of tonnes of global warming pollution. We burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, heat our homes, power our industries, fly airplanes, and drive cars. Most of the developed countries around the world have agreed to address climate change by signing and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol's major feature is mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the world's leading economies. 

Our ‘carbon footprint’ is a representation of the effect our activities have on the climate in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases we produce (measured in kg of carbon dioxide). The carbon footprint is an approximation of the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions that is caused by an activity or is accumulated over the life stages of a product. Many of our actions generate carbon emissions, which contribute to accelerating global warming and climate change. By measuring our carbon footprint, we can get a better sense of what our individual impact is and which parts of our lifestyle deserve the greatest attention. Taking into account such information we can take effective action to reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our impact on the climate.

For example, depending on the fuel efficiency of one’s vehicle and the miles travelled, a car can easily generate its own weight in carbon dioxide in the course of a year. We can reduce our carbon footprint by driving more efficient cars, or driving less. We can also plant trees or help preserve forests to offset our emissions, since trees are a sink for carbon. A significant proportion of CO2 emissions also come from building and operation of our homes. 

Ways to reduce emission of greenhouse gases include setting emissions’ standards and reducing fossil fuel use as well as endorsing alternative sources of energy to replace fossil fuels. These initiatives would have considerable results on current patterns of energy use, affecting industries and the economy. On the one hand, supporters of green technologies argue that reducing our dependence on fossil fuels could catalyze economic growth. On the other hand, critics claim that there would be substantial costs in implementing green technologies. 

The challenge we face, is how we all can enjoy a high quality of life without spoiling our world for future generations. We all have a stake in the future of Earth’s climate! To be responsible global citizens, we have to make informed choices and decisions at the local level. By conserving energy and using green technologies we cut emissions of greenhouse gases and help to reduce our impact on the planet. If many people make small changes to the way they live, this will have a considerable overall impact in reducing carbon emissions. At home, we can all help to reduce our impact on the planet by taking some simple steps to use fewer resources. Everytime we make a choice while building a house as well as while we live in our homes, everytime we turn on a light and let electrical appliances operate, we make our mark. By taking personal action at home we can reduce our carbon footprint and help reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. 


Glossary of terms

Carbon sink
The concept of carbon sinks is based on the natural ability of plants to absorb carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis and temporarily store the carbon in plant tissues. Forests as well as soils, oceans and the atmosphere store carbon, which moves among those different stores over time. The process by which carbon sinks remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is known as CO2 sequestration or carbon sequestration. Another important carbon store are fossil fuel deposits. This carbon store has been separated from the carbon cycling in the atmosphere. After the industrial revolution, carbon stored in fossil fuels is increasingly released into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil or natural gas. Through greenhouse gas emissions, human activity adds at least 6 billion tonnes of carbon per year to the atmospheric carbon cycle, which alters the intricate web of carbon fluxes, and as a consequence, alters the global climate. 

Developed world
The Developed world comprises the nations of the world which are considered more economically and technologically advanced. The Developed world is defined in contradistinction to the Developing world, which includes countries in the process of change directed toward economic growth, that is, an increase in production, per capita consumption, and income. 

Fuel efficiency
Fuel efficiency is the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work. In the context of transportation, fuel efficiency refers to the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle model, where its total output (range, or mileage) is given as a ratio of range units per unit amount of input fuel (gasoline, diesel, etc.). This ratio is given in common measures such as ‘liters per 100 kilometres’. This ratio is based on a car's total properties, including its engine properties, its body drag, weight, and rolling resistance, and as such may vary substantially from the profile of the engine alone. 

Green technologies
Green technologies are based on the application of environmental standards to inform production of goods and services and minimize the adverse environmental impacts of economic development. With rising energy costs and the threat of global warming, many citizens, businesses, and governments are now recognizing the benefits of using green technology to reduce their carbon footprint.

Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol contains legally binding emissions targets for the post-2000 period. It was negotiated in December 1997 at the city of Kyoto, Japan. The European Union and its Member States ratified the Kyoto Protocol in late May 2002. The Protocol aims at preventing anthropogenic interference with the climate system by arresting and reversing the upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions. The developed countries commit themselves to reducing their emissions of six greenhouse gases by a minimum of 5%. Each country’s emissions target must have been achieved by the period 2008-2012.

Simulations
A simulation is defined as the act of imitating the behaviour of a real phenomenon or system by means of a model analogue. The usefulness of a simulation lies in predicting the likelihood of various outcomes given a set of initial conditions of the phenomenon or system. Typical examples are aircraft flight simulators or electronic circuit simulators. Advanced computer programs can simulate weather conditions, chemical reactions, atomic reactions, even biological processes. Any phenomena that can be reduced to mathematical data and equations can be simulated on a computer. However, simulation is extremely difficult in practice, because most phenomena are subject to an almost infinite number of influences. One of ways to develop useful simulations, therefore, is to concentrate on the most important factors to determine the behaviour of the phenomenon or system.
