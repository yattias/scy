<i>Step 3: Specify variables</i><br>
Your __TOPIC_NO__ variable is:<br>
__TOPIC__
<p>
Now specify this variable into one or more indicators. In many cases, a variable indicates <i>what</i> you want to know, but not <i>how</i> this can best be measured. Directly asking respondents about variables tends to be ineffective because variables generally are too abstract, too comprehensive, or too difficult to understand by your respondents. 
<p>
<b>Example</b><br>
If your variable is “water usage for personal hygene”, you will get fuzzy and diverse answers when asking people about this variable directly (every respondent will interpret is differently). You should therefore break the variable down by specifying indicators, which are more straightforward and allow for only one interpretation:
<ul>
<li>Shower time per person
<li>Shower frequency per person
<li>Bath taking frequency per person
<li>Toilet visits per person
<li>Etc.
</ul>
Together these indicators should cover all aspects of the variable that are relevant in the context of your research question.
