<p>Copex is a tool for experimental design: here you can write down the experimental procedure in order to describe your experiment. </p>
<p>This help window gives you tips and advices to create your procedure. Depending on the mission you are involved in, Copex can be configured differently. So all the functions detailed below may not be relevant for you… </p>
<p>First, we will describe how is structured a procedure in Copex:
</p>
<table width=100% border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
  <tr>
    <td width=40><img src="icone_AdT_question.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2"> A procedure is related to a main question or objective. This item is at the top of the procedure. If the question is empty, you won't be able to go further in the description of you experiment. So, fill this item is the first task to do! </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=40><img src="icone_AdT_hypothese.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2"> You can write tour hypotheses under the light bulb. Hypotheses are used to describe the possible answer to the question and/or some properties that you believe to be true in you experiment and that won't be tested. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=40><img src="icone_AdT_principe.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2">The general principle is the rough description of the experiment. It can be interesting to write here what are the quantities you want to measure to test your hypothesis. Eventually, the principle can also be described as a schema. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=40><img src="icone_AdT_material.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2"> When you have written down the question, your hypotheses and the principle of the experiment, you have a better idea of it. It is time to indicate which material you will use. Depending of the configuration of Copex, you will have different options in order to choose the material (eventually, you can add some new material). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=40 rowspan="6" valign="top" ><div align="center"><img src="icone_AdT_manip_tasks.png" width="38" height="38" /></div></td>
    <td width="5%" valign="top" ><div align="center"><img src="icone_AdT_manip.png" width="38" height="38" /></div></td>
    <td  colspan="1">The procedure in itself will be described under one of these two icons (depending on the configuration of Copex). Below this main icon, you will have to add tasks and sub-tasks that will describe each action to be carried out during the experiment. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"   ><div align="center"><img src="Icone-AdT_tache.png" width="25" height="19" /></div></td>
    <td >This icon represents a task. Each task can further be decomposed in sub-tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" ><div align="center"><img src="Icone-AdT_tache_lock.png" width="25" height="19" /></div></td>
    <td  >If a little locker is present on a task, it means that you don't have the rights to do anything you want (e.g. to move it or to modify it).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" ><div align="center"><img src="Icone-AdT_tache_warn.png" width="25" height="19" /></div></td>
    <td  >If a little warning is present on a task, it means that this task is ill-configured, please reconsider it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" ><div align="center"><img src="Icone-AdT_etape.png" width="25" height="19" /></div></td>
    <td  >These are special task of your procedure, called steps. These steps help you to structure your procedure, and they must contain actions. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" ><div align="center"><img src="Icone-AdT_action.png" width="25" height="19" /></div></td>
    <td  >Purple icons represent the actions of your procedure. They describe the activity of the person who will execute the procedure. The description of actions (materials, parameters) must be as precise as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"><img src="icone_AdT_datasheet.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2"> In some cases, Copex will collect all the data you intend to measure during your experiment. They will be gathered under this section, called &quot;the datasheet&quot;, in order to help you during the experiment. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width=40><img src="icone_AdT_eval.png" width="38" height="38" /></td>
    <td colspan="2"> This section will be used to evaluate your procedure. Once more, there can be different configurations. You can add your personal comments in a text box, or you may be helped with guidelines. Sometimes, some comments can be made by an automatic tutor. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You can modify your procedure by double-clicking on each item. Let's see the also the functions of the buttons of the menu bar: </p>
