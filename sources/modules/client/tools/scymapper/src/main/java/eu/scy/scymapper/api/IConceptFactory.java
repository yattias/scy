 * A concept type is a pre configured concept used to make certain concepts readily available in scymapper
 * It creates a easy and quick way to configure a list of available concept nodes e.g. using spring
 * A concept type is used as a template when creating new concepts. When the user adds a new concept based
 * on a concept type, a new INodeModel instance is created with the properties of the DefaultNodeFactory copied to the
 * INodeModel instance as initial values.
