The chemical structure of linoleic acid, a common nâ 6 fatty acid found in many vegetable oils. nâ 6 fatty acids (popularly referred to as Ï â 6 fatty acids or omega-6 fatty acids) are a family of unsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbonâ carbon double bond in the nâ 6 position, that is, the sixth bond, counting from the end opposite the carboxyl group.[citation needed] The biological effects of the nâ 6 fatty acids are largely mediated by their conversion to n-6 eicosanoids that bind to diverse receptors found in every tissue of the body. The conversion of tissue arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to n-6 prostaglandin and n-6 leukotriene hormones provides many targets for pharmaceutical drug development and treatment to diminish excessive n-6 actions in atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, vascular disease, thrombosis, immune-inflammatory processes, and tumor proliferation. Competitive interactions with the nâ 3 fatty acids affect the relative storage, mobilization, conversion and action of the n-3 and n-6 eicosanoid precursors. (See Essential fatty acid interactions for more information.)

[edit] Key nâ

6 fatty acids

Linoleic acid (18:2, nâ 6), the shortest-chained nâ 6 fatty acid, is an essential fatty acid. Arachidonic acid (20:4) is a physiologically significant nâ 6 fatty acid and is the precursor for prostaglandins and other physiologically active molecules.

[edit] Negative health effects
Some medical research suggests that excessive levels of nâ 6 fatty acids, relative to nâ acids, may increase the probability of a number of diseases and depression.[1][2][3] Modern Western diets typically have ratios of nâ 6 to nâ The optimal ratio is thought to be 4 to 1 or lower.[4][5] 3 (Omega-3) fatty

3 in excess of 10 to 1, some as high as 30 to 1.

Excess nâ 6 fats interfere with the health benefits of nâ 3 fats, in part because they compete for the same rate-limiting enzymes. A high proportion of nâ 6 to nâ 3 fat in the diet shifts the physiological state in the tissues toward the pathogenesis of many diseases: prothrombotic, proinflammatory and proconstrictive.[6] Chronic excessive production of nâ 6 eicosanoids is associated with heart attacks, thrombotic stroke, arrhythmia, arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation, mood disorders, obesity, and cancer.[7] Many of the medications used to treat and manage these conditions work by blocking the effects of the potent nâ 6 fat, arachidonic acid.[8] Many steps in formation and action of n-6 hormones from n-6 arachidonic acid proceed more vigorously than the corresponding competitive steps in formation and action of n-3 hormones from n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid.[9] The COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor medications, used to treat inflammation and pain, work by preventing the COX enzymes from turning arachidonic acid into inflammatory compounds.[10] (See Cyclooxygenase for more information.) The LOX inhibitor medications often used to treat asthma, work by preventing the LOX enzyme from converting arachidonic acid into the leukotrienes.[11][12] Many of the anti-mania medications used to treat bipolar disorder work by targeting the arachidonic acid cascade in the brain.[13] A high consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are found in most types of vegetable oil, may increase the likelihood that postmenopausal women will develop breast cancer.[14] Similar effect was observed on prostate cancer.[15] Other "analysis suggested an inverse association between total polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk, but individual polyunsaturated fatty acids behaved differently [from each other]. [...] a 20:2 derivative of linoleic acid [...] was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer".[16] Contents 2

[edit] Dietary linoleic acid requirement
Adding more controversy to the nâ 6 fat issue is that the dietary requirement for linoleic acid (the key nâ 6 fatty acid), has been seriously questioned, because of a significant methodology error discovered by University of Toronto scientist Stephen Cunnane.[17] Cunnane discovered that the seminal research used to determine the dietary requirement for linoleic acid was based on feeding animals linoleic acid-deficient diets, which were simultaneously deficient in nâ 3 fats. The nâ 3 deficiency was not taken into account. The nâ 6 oils added back systematically to correct the deficiency also contained trace amounts of nâ 3 fats. Therefore the researchers were inadvertently correcting the nâ 3 deficiency as well. Ultimately, it took more oil to correct both deficiencies. According to Cunnane, this error overestimates LA requirements by 5 to 15 times.

[edit] Dietary sources

The evening primrose flower (O. biennis) produces an oil containing a high content of Î³-linolenic acid, a type of nâ 6 fatty acid. Four major food oils (palm, soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower) provide more than 100 million metric tons annually, providing more than 32 million metric tons of n-6 linoleic acid and 4 million metric tons of n-3 alpha-linolenic acid.[18] Dietary sources of nâ 6 fatty acids include:[19][dead link][clarification needed]

· poultry · eggs · avocado · nuts · cereals · whole-grain breads · most vegetable oils · evening primrose oil · borage oil · blackcurrant seed oil · flax/linseed oil · rapeseed or canola oil · hemp oil · soybean oil · cottonseed oil · sunflower seed oil · corn oil · safflower oil [edit] Dietary linoleic acid requirement 3
