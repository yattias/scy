But caffeine, even in moderate amounts, is not good for your health. Taking in too much caffeine can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn leads to other diseases.

Effect on the Mind
Caffeine stimulates the mind, making it feel less fatigued and more alert. The mind only FEELS less fatigue. In actual fact, energy is used to maintain this perception of the mind, and when the effect of caffeine wears off, the person feels even more tired than before. The mind also FEELS more confident. But, in fact, is your awareness is reduced. Caffeine often causes depression after the effect wears off, and can lead to addiction.
