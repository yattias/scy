Have Your Data Pushed!
One of the many new features available in the fourth-generation of web browsers is the ability to automatically receive content, also referred to as "push". Instead of browsing or "pulling" web pages, you can allow your computer to automatically get them for you. Both Netscape and Microsoft have created their own formats, but both follow a familiar style, based on television: channels. Microsoft based their channel technology on the same format as PointCast; we are proud to say that The FOOD Files is available in all three versions! The FOOD Files will be fully compatible with all of these programs by the time that they are no longer in beta... Internet Explorer 4.0 PR2: PointCast 2.0 Beta 1: Netscape Netcaster PR3 users click here! Now available is a new version of The FOOD Files! Now, users of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 PR2 and PointCast 2.0 can add The FOOD Files to their list of channels! You can get more information about these new beta programs at the companies' web sites: · Microsoft Corporation (http://www.microsoft.com) · PointCast Network (http://www.pointcast.com) · Netscape Communication Corporation (http://www.netscape.com) This new channel format will allow the content of The FOOD Files to be automatically downloaded to your PC. We are proud to be part of the newest internet innovation!
