Saturated fat
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Â Â (Redirected from Saturated fatty acids) Jump to: navigation, search Types of fats in food · Unsaturated fat  Monounsaturated fat  Polyunsaturated fat  Trans fat  Cis fat  Omega fatty acids: Ï â 3 Ï â 6 Ï â 9 · Saturated fat  Interesterified fat See also · Fatty acid · Essential fatty acid Saturated fat is fat that consists of triglycerides containing only saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between the individual carbon atoms of the fatty acid chain. That is, the chain of carbon atoms is fully "saturated" with hydrogen atoms. There are many kinds of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids, which mainly differ in number of carbon atoms, from 3 carbons (propionic acid) to 36 (hexatriacontanoic acid). Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fats such as cream, cheese, butter and ghee; suet, tallow, lard and fatty meats; as well as certain vegetable products such as coconut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, chocolate, and many prepared foods.[1] Serum saturated fatty acid is generally higher in smokers, alcohol drinkers and obese people.[2]

[edit] Fat profiles
While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups. Lauric and myristic acid radicals are most commonly found in "tropical" oils (e.g. palm kernel, coconut) and dairy products. The saturated fat in meat, eggs, chocolate, and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acid.

[edit] Association with diseases
[edit] Cardiovascular disease
For conflicting views and detailed discussion, see Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy The consumption of saturated fat is commonly considered a risk factor for elevated (quantitative) cholesterol levels, which in turn is a risk factor for some types of cardiovascular disease.[8][9][10] According to this view, oils that are high in saturated fats (including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil) are less healthful than oils with a lower proportion of saturated fats and higher proportions of unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, safflower, corn, sunflower, soy and cottonseed oils.[11] Not all research finds the link between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease clear. In 2010, a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found no statistically significant relationship between cardiovascular disease and dietary saturated fat.[12][13] In 2009, a systematic review of prospective cohort studies or randomized trials concluded that there was "insufficient evidence of association" between intake of saturated fatty acids and coronary heart disease (a common type of cardiovascular disease), and pointed to strong evidence for protective factors such as vegetables and a Mediterranean diet and harmful factors such as trans fats and foods with a high glycemic index.[14] A meta-analysis published in 2011 looked at the effects on coronary heart disease of transitioning from saturated fats to other sources of calories. [15] Transitions from saturated fats to polyunsaturated fats showed a 2-3% reduced risk of coronary heart disease for a 1% change in caloric intake. Transitions to carbohydrates, proteins or monounsaturated fats had no significant effect on coronary heart disease. Meta-analyses have found a significant relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol levels.[16] High serum cholesterol levels, which may be caused by many factors, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[17] A majority of original studies combined in this meta-analysis found no independent relationship between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease, which suggests that cholesterol levels that are elevated due to saturated fat intake may be less dangerous than cholesterol levels that are elevated for other reasons.[18] However, saturated fat intake may be associated with fatal outcomes from coronary heart disease.[18] Substitution of the fat from one ounce of nuts for equivalent energy from saturated fat was associated with a 45% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease.[19]

[edit] Cancer
[edit] Breast cancer Further information: Epidemiology and etiology of breast cancer#Specific dietary fatty acids A meta-analysis published in 2003 found a significant positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer.[20] [edit] Colorectal cancer A systematic literature review published by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research in 2007 found limited but consistent evidence for a positive relationship between animal fat and colorectal cancer.[21]

Saturated fat - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia [edit] Ovarian cancer A meta-analysis published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.[22] [edit] Prostate cancer Further information: Prostate cancer#Oils and fatty acids Some researchers have indicated that serum myristic acid[23][24] and palmitic acid[24] and dietary myristic[25] and palmitic[25] saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation[23] are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.[24] [edit] Small intestine cancer A prospective study of data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study explained cancer of the small intestine may be partly correlated with saturated fat intake.[26]

[edit] Dietary Recommendations
Recommendations to reduce or limit dietary intake of saturated fats are made by Health Canada,[27] the US Department of Health and Human Services,[28] the UK Food Standards Agency,[29] the Australian Department of Health and Aging,[30] the Singapore Government Health Promotion Board,[31] the Indian Government Citizens Health Portal,[32] the New Zealand Ministry of Health,[33] the Food and Drugs Board Ghana,[34] the Republic of Guyana Ministry of Health,[35] Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety [36] and the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization.[37] A 2004 statement released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) determined that "Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intakeâ ¦"[38] Additionally, reviews by the American Heart Association led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations.[39][40] This concurs with similar conclusions made by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Department of Health and Human Services, both of which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.[41][42][43] The World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that saturated fats negatively affect cholesterol profiles, predisposing individuals to heart disease, and recommends avoiding saturated fats in order to reduce the risk of a cardiovascular disease.[44][45] Dr German and Dr Dillard of University of California and Nestle Research Center in Switzerland, in their 2004 review, pointed out that "no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified".[46] No randomized clinical trials of low-fat diets or low-saturated fat diets of sufficient duration have been carried out. The influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.[47]

The relevance of particular information in (or previously in) this article or section is disputed.
The information may have been removed or included by an editor as a result. Please see discussion on the talk page considering whether its inclusion is warranted.(March 2008)

See also: Lipid hypothesis An association between serum levels of fatty acids and disease does not in itself establish causality.[48][49] · The formation of exogenous (outside the body) advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and oxidation products generated during cooking may be a confounding factor that some studies may not have controlled for. It has been suggested that, "given the prominence of this type of food in the human diet, the deleterious effects of high-(saturated)fat foods may be in part due to the high content in glycotoxins, above and beyond those due to oxidized fatty acid derivatives." The glycotoxins as described in the study are more commonly called AGEs.[50] · Saturated fat intakes may be monitored more closely than were total fat intakes, therefore ignoring the possibility that simply a larger fat intake may lead to a higher risk of coronary diseases. It also suggests that other parameters may be overlooked, such as carbohydrates intakes.[51]
