[ Soccer | Basketball | Swimming | Canoeing | Squash | Volleyball | Baseball | Javelin | Triathlon | Surfing | Netball | Shot-put | Discus | Jumping | Hockey ] Most teenagers are actively involved in sports activities during their school years. Some of them are representing their class, school and even their country in competition. However, victory does not come without proper planning and hard work and is attributed to many factors. The diet pertaining to that particular sport constitutes a very important factor in this case. With proper diet, you can "engineer" your body to the best form for an event and increase efficiency in training. Hence, most of the competitors will find it useful browsing through the list below. For Sports Diets, click here.

Soccer
Since a game of Soccer lasts 90 minutes, carbohydrates are essential for performance. Diets must therefore be high in carbohydrates (70%), low in fat (15%), and include a normal intake of protein (15%). Carbohydrate intake must be very high in the 24 hours leading up to a game. High fiber, high fat, and high protein meals should be avoided for at least a day before competing. Carbohydrates and water must then be consumed as soon as possible following a match in order to replace both water lost through sweating and muscle glycogen. Fluid is lost during exercise through the need to lose excess heat via sweating. Because a soccer game takes 90 minutes to complete, players should drink a mildly sugared water solution at every available opportunity. This will help delay fatigue and assist a team to play well in the latter stages of a game. Dehydration is a very dangerous condition and must be avoided at all costs. Regular drinking helps avoid dehydration; whereas water can help delay the rate of dehydration, sugar can help maintain blood glucose levels and spare the limited muscle glycogen reserves.

Basketball
Carbohydrate intake must be very high in the 24 hours leading up to a game. The main meal before competing should include pasta (with a low fat sauce) or a bread-based meal (with a low fat spread). High fiber (e.g., bran), high fat (fried foods) and high protein meals (e.g., meat- or fish-based foods) should be avoided for at least a day before competing. In addition, carbohydrates must be consumed as soon as possible following a match - to replace what is known as muscle glycogen. Fluid Replacement - Fluids are lost during exercise through the need to sweat. Because a match takes 40 minutes to complete, basketball players should drink a mildly sugared water solution between games. This will delay fatigue and help a team play well in the latter stages of a game. Dehydration is a very dangerous condition and must be avoided at all costs. Regular drinking helps avoid dehydration. Your pharmacist can help explain the significance of commercially Back to Top 1

Injury Recovery - Fresh fruits and vegetables daily, along with protein, e.g., fish, chicken, eggs, lean beef, or lamb, will give your body what it needs to provide the extra energy you need for exercise and to repair any damaged tissue. Foods high in the substances needed for rebuilding and strengthening ligaments, muscles, tendons and joints include; oats, okra, raw muesli, tripe and pig's trotters.

Swimming
As with most sports, two things are essential for swimming, particularly in hot and humid conditions. First, swimmers get their energy from carbohydrates. A swimmer should eat a diet high in carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, cereals, rice, fruit and vegetables. To help recover between swimming sessions, the swimmer should eat or drink (juices or sports drinks) carbohydrates within 30 minutes of leaving the water. The second dietary need is fluids. On hot and humid days a swimmer can lose a lot of fluids. Drinking water before and during training can help prevent dehydration and help the swimmer train better. A sports drink during training can help replace the lost fluids more quickly as well as give the swimmer energy to train harder. Drinking fluids of any kind (except alcohol or coffee) after a swim will replace the fluids lost when training. A sports drink or fruit juice will help replace both the fluids and carbohydrate lost during training. Ask your pharmacist for advice. Competition Diet --- Carbohydrate and fluid intake should increase in the 24 hours before competition or a swim training session. High fiber, high fat and high protein meals should be avoided the day before and the day of competition. The meals eaten should be food the swimmer is used to, with carbohydrate snacks between meals. The competitive swimmer should replace carbohydrates in liquid (juice or sports drink) or solid form after each training session or race.

Canoeing
Carbohydrate intake must be very high in the 24 hours leading up to competition - particularly for the endurance canoeist. The main meal before competing should include pasta (with a low fat sauce) or a bread-based meal (with a low fat spread). High fiber (e.g., bran), high fat (fried foods), and high protein meals (e.g., meat- or fish-based foods) should be avoided for at least a day before competing. In addition, carbohydrates must be consumed as soon as possible following exercise - to replace what is known as muscle glycogen. If the slalom canoeist has to compete more than once on the same day, then a high carbohydrate meal during the 24 hours before competition is also vital. In addition, carbohydrates must be consumed frequently throughout the day of competition. Bananas, sandwiches, energy bars, etc. are ideal sources of carbohydrates in 'snack' form. Fluid Intake --- Fluids are lost during exercise through the need to sweat. Canoeists should, therefore, frequently drink a mildly sugared water solution during the day. Dehydration is a very dangerous condition and must be avoided at all costs. Regular drinking helps avoid dehydration. Your pharmacist can help explain the significance of commercially available 'sports drinks'.

Squash
Back to Top 2

The FOOD Files: Sports Participation A high carbohydrate diet (60-70% of the daily caloric intake) is needed to cope with both training and playing. Breads, pasta and rice-based dishes are ideal for meeting a high carbohydrate intake. However, sauces and spreads must be low in fat. A normal intake of protein (15-20%) and fat (15-20%) is desirable for all athletes - including squash players. Because squash players can 'hit the wall' (i.e., run out of muscle glycogen) during a match, carbohydrate intake must be very high in the 24 hours leading up to a game. The main meal before competing could include pasta (with a low fat sauce) or a bread-based meal (with a low fat spread). High fiber (e.g., bran), high fat (fried foods) and high protein meals (e.g., meat- or fish-based foods) should be avoided for at least a day before competing. In addition, carbohydrates must be consumed as soon as possible following a match to replace what is known as muscle glycogen. Fluid is lost during exercise through the need to sweat. Because a squash match could take anywhere between 30 minutes and 90 minutes to complete, players should drink a mildly sugared water solution between games. This will delay fatigue and help a team play well in the latter stages of a game. Dehydration is a very dangerous condition and must be avoided at all costs. Regular drinking helps avoid dehydration. Your pharmacist can help explain the significance of commercially available 'sports drinks'.

Baseball
A high carbohydrate diet (60-70% of the daily caloric intake) is needed to cope with the training load. Breads, pasta and rice-based dishes are ideal for meeting a high carbohydrate intake. However, sauces and spreads must be low in fat. A normal intake of protein (15-20%) and fat (15-20%) is desirable for all athletes including baseball players. Since baseball players are not at risk of 'glycogen depletion' or 'hitting the wall', an extremely high carbohydrate meal before competition is not necessary. However, given that a game could last for an extended period of time, carbohydrate intake should be high during the day of competition. Bananas, sandwiches, 'energy bars', etc., would be appropriate foods. During the course of extended competition, fluids will inevitably be lost; and athletes should consider drinking a weakly sugared water solution during the day. Back to Top 3

Javelin
A high carbohydrate diet (60-70% of the daily caloric intake) is needed to cope with the training load. Breads, pasta and rice-based dishes are ideal for meeting a high carbohydrate intake. However, sauces and spreads must be low in fat. A normal intake of protein (15-20%) and fat (15-20%) is desirable for all athletes including throwers. Throwers are not at risk of 'glycogen depletion' or 'hitting the wall' and an extremely high carbohydrate meal before competition is not necessary. During the course of extended competition (i.e., several heats in the same day), fluid will inevitably be lost, and athletes should consider drinking a weakly sugared water solution during the day.

Triathlon
Carbohydrates is where swimming, cycling and running muscles get their energy. A triathlete should eat a diet high in carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, cereals, rice, fruit, and vegetables. To help recover between training sessions or after races, triathletes should eat or drink (juices or sports drinks) carbohydrates within 30 minutes of finishing racing or training. The other major dietary need is fluids. On hot and humid days, a triathlete can lose over 2 liters of fluid an hour. Drinking water before training or racing can help prevent dehydration. In smaller triathlons under an hour, drinking 200-250mls water every 15-20 minutes is suggested. In longer events, sports drinks containing carbohydrates, a little sodium, and a small amount of potassium, are essential and should be taken as suggested above. If a triathlete is feeling drained of energy, he/she may need vitamin or mineral supplements, such as those found in pharmacies. While a well-balanced diet should prevent the need for such supplements, if a triathlete is feeling consistently tired, a specialist's advice should be sought. A competitive female triathlete or males involved in long, heavy training may need dietary iron supplements. Carbohydrate and fluid intake should increase in the three days before competition or before a long training session. High fiber, high fat and high protein meals should be avoided the day before competing. The meals eaten before competition should be food the triathlete is used to, along with carbohydrate snacks taken between meals. A light carbohydrate meal (e.g., toast and honey) might be suggested at least 2 hours prior to an event.

Surfing
Diet Hints --- Two things are essential for surfing, particularly in hot and humid conditions. First, carbohydrates give surfers their energy. A surfer should eat a diet high in carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, cereals, rice, fruit and vegetables. To help recover between surfing sessions, the surfer should eat or drink (juices or sports drinks) carbohydrates within 30 minutes of leaving the water. The second dietary need is fluids.

Netball
Netball is a sport which combines specific ball skills, speed, agility and aerobic endurance. Because of the high energy used, the diet plan should twofold -- on one hand, meeting the needs of growth for the younger player and, on the other, helping to maintain good health and a high level of performance in both training and competition. With aerobic endurance being a key in the overall fitness for the netballer, carbohydrates play an important role. Complex carbohydrate foods should be the major constituents of the the nutritionally balanced intake. Complex carbohydrate foods include wholegrain breads, rice, pasta, wholegrain breakfast cereals, fruits and vegetables. Wholegrain breads and cereals are good sources of carbohydrates, B group vitamins, and vitamin E. Choose a daily selection of fruits and vegetables and, in particular, green, leafy and salad vegetables, and citrus fruits, such as oranges and mandarins for Vitamin C. Low fat sources of protein foods are also important as part of a nutritionally balanced diet. These are required for the growth and repair of new and old tissue/muscle, and at the same time be a good source of iron. This is of particular importance, with present research indicating that a large number of women do not consume their recommended intake of dietary iron. These foods should form a part of your daily food intake and ,whenever possible, use lean cuts of meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian alternative such as baked beans. Keep your weight under control, as this will help with respect to agility and speed and, therefore, overall performance. Using low fat products, minimizing the use of fats and oils, and practicing low fat cooking methods will go a long way in achieving and maintaining this goal. To maximize performance at both training and competition it is vital to consume water, fruit juice or special fluids at regular intervals, both before, during, and after competition and training. If the diet is considered inadequate, some nutritional supplements might be suggested. You should eat foods that contain Vitamin C, the Vitamin B group, Vitamin E, Iron, Zinc, and Calcium. Many athletes opt to also take Liquid Meal Supplements.

Shot-put
A high carbohydrate diet (60-70% of the daily caloric intake) is needed to cope with the training load; breads, pasta and rice-based dishes are ideal for meeting a high carbohydrate intake (sauces and spreads must be low in fat!). A normal intake of protein (15-20%) and fat (15-20%) is desirable for all athletes - including shot-putters. Excessive protein intake is not productive.

However, if a shot-putter has to compete over several hours, then carbohydrate intake should be high during the day of competition. Bananas, sandwiches, 'energy bars' etc. would be appropriate foods. Fluid Intake During the course of extended competition, fluid will inevitably be lost; throwers could benefit from drinking a weakly sugared water solution during the day (ask your pharmacist for advice).

Jumping
A high carbohydrate diet (60-70% of the daily caloric intake) is needed to cope with the training load; breads, pasta and rice-based dishes are ideal for meeting a high carbohydrate intake. However, sauces and spreads must be low in fat. A normal intake of protein (15-20%) and fat (15-20%) is desirable for all athletes including jumpers. It is the carbohydrate which is the most important dietary constituent for maintaining a heavy training load. Jumpers are not at risk of 'glycogen depletion' or 'hitting the wall' and an extremely high carbohydrate meal before competition is not productive. However, if a long or triple jumper has to complete several jumps in one day, then carbohydrate intake should be high during the day of competition. Bananas, sandwiches, 'energy bars' etc. would be appropriate foods. Fluids will inevitably be lost during the course of extended competition (i.e., several jumps on the same day); athletes should consider drinking a weakly sugared water solution throughout the day (ask your pharmacist for advice on suitable commercially-available products).

Hockey
Given that a game of Hockey lasts for over 70 minutes and that players are expected to repeat dozens of sprints while running for several kilometers, carbohydrates (i.e., the main constituent is foods such as bread and pasta) are important for maintaining performance.
