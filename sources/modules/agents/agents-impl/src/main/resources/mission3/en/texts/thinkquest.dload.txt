do not recommend that you download Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 at this time. It is currently in Beta Testing, and many bugs have not yet been worked out. ICQ and PointCast Betas should run normally, but since IE4 alters many of your system files and settings, it is not recommended for most users to download it at this time. For more information, see the home pages of each company. Also, this site is not optimized for Netscape browsers. However, for those of you who wish to download and use it, we do offer a Netcaster Channel in addition to the IE4/PointCast Channel. Unfortunately, Windows 3.1 users are not supported by Netcaster or PointCast; Macintosh users are not yet supported at all. Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02
