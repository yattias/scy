There is a guideline for the amount of fat you should take in. Here we help you find your Daily Fat Allowance. When you know your Daily Fat Allowance, try to make sure that you do not take in excess fat. You can check the amount of fat in your food by looking through the nutritional statistics of different foods.

Fat Allowance Calculator
Step by Step Calculation
1) Check your daily energy needs in calories. 2) Calculate the amount of energy you will obtain from your fat intake: Calories from Fat = 25% of Daily Energy Needs = Daily Energy Needs x 25/100 3) Calculate Total Fat Allowance: Total Fat Allowance (g) (1 g fat = 9 Cal) 4) Calculate Saturated Fat Allowance: Saturated Fat Allowance (g) = Total Fat Allowance / 3 = Energy from Fat / 9

5) Calculate Unsaturated Fat Allowance Unsaturated Fat Allowance (g) = Total Fat Allowance * 2 / 3

Example
