Eyes Eat food with more Vitamin A, such as carrots. Hair Hair condition can be an indicator of general health, and some dietary deficiencies may be indicated by
loss of condition in hair, especially trace elements such as zinc and B complex vitamin deficiencies. Hair loss can be also be due to excess Vitamin A and niacin.

Skin The condition of the skin is a good indicator of a person

s general state of health. A healthy skin needs a full complement of essential fatty acids. People on low-fat diets often develop skin disorders. The micronutrients that affect the skin most directly are Vitamin A and Vitamin E as well as riboflavin, niacin, biotin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, selenium and para-aminobenzoic acid. Deficiencies of one or several of these micronutrients may cause dryness, roughness, itching, scaliness, wrinkling, pale patches, pronounced stretch marks, slow healing of wounds and acne. Evening primose oil, honey and infusions of cider vinegar or chamomile are reported to have beneficial effects on a number of skin conditions. Skin diseases such as eczema and dermatitis can be caused by food allergies.

Teeth Good supplies of Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, fluorine, and molybdenum are
needed to maintain strong, healthy teeth. Bacteria on the teeth (plaque) metabolize sugars in food, especially sucrose, and release lactic acid. The acid gradually breaks down the enamel and, eventually the dentine of the tooth, causing toothache. Susceptibility to dental cavities can be reduced by good oral hygiene, by reducing the amount of sugars (especially sucrose) in the diet, and by ensuring an adequate intake of fluoride.

Nails The texture and coloring of nails is often affected by a specific vitamin or mineral deficiency (e.g. the
spoon-shaped nail is characteristic of iron-deficiency anemia (this may not be the only cause). A medical diagnosis should be sought before starting vitamin or mineral therapy.
