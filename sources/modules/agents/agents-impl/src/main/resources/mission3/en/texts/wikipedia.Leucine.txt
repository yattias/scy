Leucine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L)[2] is a branched-chain Î±-amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2CH(CH3)2. It is an essential amino acid, which means that humans cannot synthesize it. Its codons are UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. With a hydrocarbon side chain, leucine is classified as a hydrophobic amino acid. It has an isobutyl R group. Leucine is a major component of the sub units in ferritin, astacin and other 'buffer' proteins.

[edit] Biosynthesis
As an essential amino acid, leucine is not synthesized in animals, hence it must be ingested, usually as a component of proteins. It is synthesized in plants and microorganisms via several steps starting from pyruvic acid. The initial part of the pathway also leads to valine. The intermediate Î±-ketovalerate is converted to Î±-isopropylmalate and then Î²-isopropylmalate, which is dehydrogenated to Î±-ketoisocaproate, which in the final step undergoes reductive amination. Enzymes involved in a typical leucine biosynthesis include[3] · Acetolactate synthase, · Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, · Dihydroxyacid dehydratase, · Î±-Isopropylmalate synthase, · Î±-Isopropylmalate isomerase, · Leucine aminotransferase.

[edit] Biology
Leucine is utilized in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. In adipose and muscle tissue, leucine is used in the formation of sterols, and the combined usage of leucine in these two tissues is seven times greater than its use in the liver.[4] Leucine is the only dietary protein that has the capacity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. [5] As a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats.[6] Leucine toxicity, as seen in decompensated Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), causes delirium and neurologic compromise, and can be life-threatening.

Leucine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia In yeast genetics, mutants with a defective gene for leucine synthesis (leu2) are transformed with a plasmid that contains a working leucine synthesis gene (LEU2) and grown on minimal media. Leucine synthesis then becomes a useful selectable marker.

(S)-Leucine (left) and (R)-leucine (right) in zwitterionic form at neutral pH

[edit] Chemical properties
Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) since it possesses an aliphatic side-chain that is non-linear. Racemic leucine had been subjected to circularly polarized synchrotron radiation in order to better understand the origin of biomolecular asymmetry. An enantiomeric enhancement of 2.6 % had been induced, indicating a photochemical origin of biomolecules' homochirality.[8]

[edit] Food additive
As a food additive, L-Leucine has E number E641 and is classified as a flavor enhancer.
