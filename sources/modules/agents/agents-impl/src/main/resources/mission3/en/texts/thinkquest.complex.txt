Get Rid of Those Pimples
The skin is the outermost layer of our body, and everyday it is exposed to all kinds of substances. Smooth skin is more visually appealing. A common enemy many teenagers face is acne. Though there are many skin care products which can help cure acne, it is also possible to deal with the pimples on your face with diet. There are pores all over your skin. They secrete oil to keep the skin moist and release sweat to cool you down when you are hot. Upon reaching puberty, the pores on your face will secrete more oil, and this oil will block the pores if not cleaned off. More oil builds up at the pores, causing bumps known as pimples. The rate of oil secretion can be slowed down by cooling yourself down. This can mean washing your face more often, taking "cool" food, such as fruits and vegetables, and drinking plenty of water. You should also prevent taking in "heavy" foods, such as fried food, chili, spicy food and greasy food. No matter what diet you choose, if you do not keep your face clean, pimples will still develop. See a dermatologist (dermatology is the branch of medicine that is concerned with the physiology and pathology of the skin) if your problem is really serious.
