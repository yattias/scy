Assignment to present the final design of the CO2-friendly house
When you have reached this point in the mission, you should have completed the final design of your CO2-friendly house. In this part of the mission, you need to prepare a presentation of your house’s design in the form of a poster. Your poster will be shared with the rest of the class. For this purpose, you need to use the Presentation Tool of the SCY-Lab to create a poster. Use any type of tool to highlight important elements on your poster. 

You can incorporate in your presentation the learning objects that you have included in your portfolio so far, at least those you consider important to be included in your poster. In this regard, you can include in your presentation small texts, images, figures, graphs, concept maps, simulation results, and any other learning object you feel the need to present. The Presentation Tool, also, offers you the opportunity to prepare new texts and drawings. 

The following points can be indicative of the content of your poster: (1) hypotheses; (2) web resources browsed; (3) expert conceptualizations; (4) annotated concept maps; (5) screenshots depicting simulation results; (6) brief description of the activities you followed in order to generate the design; (7) various elements of your design (e.g. total useable surface of the house; number of inhabitants; structure and insulation of walls, roof, and floor; type of doors, windows; air flow as determined by the ventilation system; units of power (watt) at which each appliance operates; energy supply).

As soon as you complete your presentation, let your teacher know that you are ready to present your design to the rest of the class. You should also agree on who will present which part of the poster!
