Green building techniques used on C60 House
Concern over global warming and depletion of the ozone layer has stimulated research to develop energy-efficient systems and sustainable buildings. The project run by the University of Nottingham is known as the C60 house which should cut carbon emissions by a minimum of 60% on the typical UK home and it’s part of a plan by the government to make all new homes ‘carbon neutral’. Carbon neutral houses help prevent damage to the environment and have the additional bonus of saving home-owners’ energy bills.

 The government wants all new homes to be carbon neutral in 10 years, C60 is working to achieve this by using:

    * a rainwater tank on the roof - bathwater will be reused in the toilet cutting water by 70%
    * appliances and lighting will be low energy cutting electricity by 60%
    * extra insulation and air heated deep under the basement cutting on heating by 70%

The C60 house project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy efficient homes of the future. Six homes will be designed and constructed on the University Park to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/ renewable energy technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply.

The C60 house project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. Several companies including: Stoneguard, Roger Bullivant Ltd, EON, BASF have agreed to fund the project.
Carbon Neutral Home

The UK Government is looking to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20% by the year 2010 but this is set against the projection of a further 4.2 million new houses being constructed between now and 2016.

Dwellings in the UK account for approximately 28% of the UK total of carbon dioxide emissions through the burning of fossil fuel for heating, lights and appliances. This includes combustion on the premises, mainly natural gas for heating and cooking, and combustion in power stations to produce electricity for homes. Space heating accounts for 57%; water heating a further 25%; cooking 5% and lights and appliances 13%. The demand for energy to run heating/hot water systems and other home appliances such as refrigerators, cookers, lighting, etc is expected to be 13% higher in 2010 than it was in 1990.

Consequently, if the CO2 emissions target is to be achieved, it will be necessary to develop better construction techniques and new and renewable energy technologies for building applications.
C60 house

The C60 house is an example of inter-institute collaboration, with the first C60 house, the Stoneguard C60, designed by interdisciplinary members of the School’s teaching staff, Mr Guillermo Guzman (Architecture) and Dr Mark Gillott (ISET) under the leadership of Professor Saffa Riffat. A construction workforce of undergraduate students from architecture and building technology will work on the build, and PhD students will undertake a number of research studies associated with the construction. As a building project within a few metres of the main building, the Stoneguard C60 house is a showpiece to all students of innovative construction methods.

The Government’s Energy White Paper of 2003 sets a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050. The Carbon 60 House addresses all four principles of the Government’s Energy White Paper: the 60% emissions reduction target, fuel poverty, security of supply and competitiveness as well as demonstrating the latest modern methods of construction. The C60 house will be built using fast-track prefabrication techniques. These techniques facilitate high levels of environmental performance, speed up the house building process and reduce wastage and defects.

The four bed C60 house will be constructed over three levels including a basement and roof space areas. The combined use of a light weight steel frame structure and a concrete basement generates an efficient interior volume which provides both space and functionality. Balconies have also been incorporated to provide a link with the outside as well as providing solar shading.

The C60 house is orientated with its longest facade facing south to maximise solar energy utilisation. The service areas in the house (kitchen, bathrooms) are located on the rear or north facade and in the same vertical plan for the purposes of construction efficiency. The living spaces are open plan in design to maximise ventilation, space and natural light, all regarded as high priorities by today’s home buyers. In addition large areas have been set aside for storage and a services stack is provided to facilitate construction and maintenance.

And once the C60 house in Nottingham is complete students will move in! You can find out more about the C60 house here.
