Environmentally Friendly, Non Toxic Paint All paints contain three 				main components: pigment (colour), a binder (holds the paint 				together) and a carrier (disperses the binder). With many modern 				paints these ingredients are made using toxic chemicals that are 				harmful to both the environment and human health. Cadmium, lead and 				chromium are frequently used in pigments; and petrochemicals, 				solvents, benzene, formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds 				(VOCs) are used in binders and carriers. Toxic, environmentally 				harmful, chemicals are also used in modern paints as preservatives, 				stabilisers, thickeners and driers. VOCs are organic (carbon based) 				chemical compounds that evaporate easily in the atmosphere, and are 				known to be a major contributor to global climate change. Many of 				them are highly toxic and linked with numerous health problems such 				as respiratory disease, asthma, dizziness, headaches, nausea, 				fatigue, skin disorders, eye irritation, liver and kidney damage and 				even cancer. Modern chemical paints continue to emit VOCs many years 				after their application. Increasing concerns about the impact of 				chemical paints on health and the environment have led to a growing 				market in non-toxic paints. Environmental regulations have forced 				conventional paint companies to significantly reduce their VOC 				content, and most of the large paint companies now offer one or more 				varieties of non-toxic paints. However, many of these still contain 				VOC solvents, chemical pigments and fungicides. Eco Labels for 				Paints Non-toxic paints are often called Low-VOC, No-VOC, VOC-Free, 				odourless, odour-free and green, natural or organic paints. There 				are no set standards for defining these labels, and they are widely 				misused for marketing purposes. To help consumers make informed 				decisions on their paint purchases, various ecological labels have 				been developed by different countries to indicate that the paint has 				fulfilled certain environmental requirements, in accordance with 				respective government regulations. These eco-labels can be found as 				logos on paint cans, and include the European Eco-Label, Blue Angel 				in Germany, and Green Seal and Greenguard in the USA. In the UK, VOC 				labels are used, and indicate the content of VOCs using one of five 				classifications: Minimal (0-0.29%), Low, Medium, High and Very High 				(VOC content greater than 50%). Low-VOC paints tend to use water as 				a carrier instead of petrochemical solvents, and so their emissions 				are minimal. Many conventional paints have achieved relatively low 				VOC levels. No-VOC or VOC-Free paints may still contain very low 				levels of VOCs in their pigments or additives. Although reducing VOC 				content is a move in the right direction, it is questionable whether 				either of these paint types can be considered non-toxic. Natural 				Paints Natural paints are the only true non-toxic paint since they 				contain no VOCs, and are made from natural ingredients such as 				water, vegetable oils, plant dyes, and natural minerals. The main 				binders used in natural paints are: linseed oil (from flax seeds), 				clay, lime, and milk protein. Lime and milk paints give an authentic 				period look, and are often used in antique restoration projects. 				Chalk is used as an extender to thicken paint; turpentine (distilled 				from pine trees) is used as a solvent; essential oils from citrus 				fruits (d-limonene) are used as a solvent and fragrance; and natural 				mineral and earth pigments are used as colorants. The main benefits 				of natural paints are: Non-toxic - no hazardous fumes or harmful 				effects on health. This is significant for allergy sufferers and 				chemically sensitive people who are unable to tolerate chemical 				paints. Environmentally Friendly - use renewable resources; are 				biodegradable, can even be composted. Micro-Porous - allow walls and 				surfaces to breathe, preventing condensation and damp problems, and 				reducing associated indoor allergens. They are also less prone to 				paint flaking, peeling and blistering. On the downside, natural 				paints can be more expensive because they are made on a smaller 				scale, although this situation is changing as they become more 				popular. Natural paints can also take longer to dry (sometimes up to 				24 hours or more) and there is less of a colour range to choose 				from. Natural mineral pigments tend to produce paints that come in 				pastel shades only, and this has led some natural paint companies to 				use synthetic pigments to create a more extensive range of colours. 				Paints for a Sustainable Future Unlike conventional paint companies, 				natural paint suppliers are committed to making sure their materials 				derive from sustainable sources and are manufactured in an 				environmentally friendly way. They aim to minimise pollution, energy 				and waste throughout the life cycle of their products. Natural paint 				companies give thought to the recyclable packaging of their 				products, and they also declare their product ingredients so that 				consumers know exactly what they are using. Because natural paints 				are non-toxic, they are completely safe and this makes them the 				obvious choice for any consumer concerned with protecting the earth 				and its people for future generations.;       </hypothesis> 			<comment language="fr">any comments</comment> 			<hypothesis_hide>false</hypothesis_hide> 		</proc_hypothesis> 		<proc_general_principle> 			<principle language="fr">To change operational standards of 				electric appliances and check for corresponding effects on energy 				consumption.
