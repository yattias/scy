<p><strong>7.1: Create a pizza</strong><br />
  Taking into consideration what you  studied so far, you are asked to create your own virtual healthy pizza. In  doing so, you will use the pizza simulation tool you used in activity 1.1.</p>
<p>TABLE 8</p>
<p><strong>7.1.1. Methodology using the SCY  experimental design tool.</strong><br />
  Use the &lsquo;SCY experimental design  tool&rsquo; to indicate the steps you followed in creating your pizza and determine  the criteria according to which you have chosen the various ingredients.  Present the steps you followed to the rest of the class and discuss with your  teammates the criteria other groups presented.<br />

<p><strong>7.2: Optimization strategy </strong><br />
  In the next activity you will study  an example of the optimization strategy, which will help you choose the  healthiest pizza ingredients. The optimization strategy is a method used to  make a decision when more than one option is available. The strategy calls for  a two-step process. During the first step, the parameters of each option are  identified and scored on a common scale, based on their characteristics. During  the second step, all parameters are weighted based on their importance and  multiplied with their scale score. The total score for each option is obtained  by summing up all parameter scores of each option. The best option has the  highest score.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of the optimization strategy: 1st step</strong><br />
  Mr. Adam is about to buy a new car.  He has already done some research and has excluded various models of cars. Now  he is down to a choice of three:</p>
<p>FIGURE 4</p>
<p>Mr. Adam will buy one of the above  cars and his choice will be based exclusively on the following criteria: (a)  cost (the cheaper the better) (b) fuel consumption (the least the better) (c)  duration of guarantee provided by the dealer (the longer the better). The  following table provides the information for each car concerning the three  specific criteria:</p>
<p>TABLE 9</p>
<p>As you can see in the table above,  it is very difficult for Mr. Adam to choose among the three cars which one is  better. Car B is the cheapest vehicle and has the lowest fuel consumption,  however, it has the shortest guarantee time. Car A on the other hand, has a  longer guaranty but consumes a bit more fuel and it cost more money than car B.  Finally, car C has the longest guarantee but it&rsquo;s much more expensive and it  consumes a lot more fuel. Since, Mr. Adam wants to take into account these  three criteria, you should find out which one of the three cars offers the best  combination of advantages and disadvantages. Discuss with your teammates how  Mr. Adam could overcome this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.2.1: Importance of criteria.</strong><br />
  The  first step is to convert all the data into one common scale. In the table  bellow, each criterion is given a value based on the characteristics of each  car. For example, for the &lsquo;cost&rsquo; criterion, Mr. Adam assigned car C a low score  of 5 since it is the most expensive of the three vehicles. In contrast, he  assigned car B a score of 10 since it is the cheapest. Car A received a high  score of 9 since it&rsquo;s also cheap but not as cheap as car B. The last column  provides a total score for all criteria of each car. In this case, Mr. Adam  would have chosen Car B.</p>
<p>TABLE 10</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of the optimization strategy: 2nd  step</strong> <br />
  Until  now, Mr. Adam considered the three criteria as equally important. However, in a  discussion he had with a friend, who is more knowledgeable about cars, made him  realize that the &lsquo;guarantee&rsquo; is the most important criterion and that the cost  is more important than fuel consumption. Thus, while he should take into  consideration all three criteria, he must give somehow more emphasis on the  guarantee (10 on a scale of 10), then the cost (8 on a scale of 10) and finally  the fuel consumption (5 on a scale of 10) of each car.</p>
<p>The  following tables present the new total scores based on the emphasis of each  criterion: </p>
<p>TABLE 11</p>
<p>Based  on the new scores from the optimization strategy, Mr. Adam decided to choose  car A instead of car B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.2.2: Evaluation of the optimization  strategy</strong><br />
  Discuss  with your teammates the meaning of the concept &lsquo;importance of criteria&rsquo;.  Evaluate whether you consider the implementation of the optimization strategy,  in the example with the cars, useful. How could this strategy be applied in the  context of the creation of a healthy pizza? Present your team conclusions to  the rest of the class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.2.3: Implementation of the optimization  strategy in the context of a healthy pizza.</strong><br />
  In  order to apply the optimization strategy in the context of a healthy pizza, you  should follow a process similar to the one followed by Mr. Adam when purchasing  a car. Before you begin, however, first you need to recall all the ingredients  you selected during the first and second pizza simulation (part 1.1 and 7.1.1)  and create a table listing the nutrients (carbohydrates, fat, protein, etc.),  energy and cost of each of the pizza ingredient you chose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.2.3.1: Pizza optimization strategy: 1st  step</strong><br />
  Now you will have to score each  ingredient you selected up to this point so that you exalt all the criteria  (nutrients, energy and cost) on a common scale. You can use the table you  created in the previous activity in order to apply the first step of the  optimization strategy. After you complete the activity, exchange ELOs with one  of your group members for peer-assessment.</p>
<p>TABLE 12</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.2.3.2: Pizza optimization strategy: 2nd  step</strong> <strong></strong><br />
  Recall the second step of the optimization strategy applied  by Mr. Adam in the example with the cars. Follow a similar process and complete  the table below calculating the new total score for each ingredient.</p>
<p>TABLE 13</p>
<p>In addition, one of your classmates stated the following:  the nutrients of the ingredients are the most important of the three criteria.  The amount of energy (kcal) is more important than the cost. Discuss the  statements with your group members. Do you agree or disagree with these  statements? What is the reasoning behind your answer?<strong></strong></p>
