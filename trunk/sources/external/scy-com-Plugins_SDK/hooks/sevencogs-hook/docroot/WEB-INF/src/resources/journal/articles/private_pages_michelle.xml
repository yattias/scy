Only I can see them, edit them and create new ones.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Social Space - Shows my friends and their activities.</li>
    <li>Work Space - Has my calendar, documents, images...</li>
    <li>Email - I can configure this page to view my emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add more applications just go to the dock menu and select Add Application.</p>
<p>You can also add widgets from any other website. I have already added a widget for twitter which was very easy, by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add Application --&gt; iframe portlet</li>
    <li>Go to Configuration of the portlet and set the Url to <a href="https://twitterforiphone.com/login">https://twitterforiphone.com/login</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Any mobile web application or widget for the iphone will work perfectly in your instance of Liferay Portal using this method.</p>
