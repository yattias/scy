Do you ever look in the mirror and worry about what you see? Does the bulge you grab when you pinch your arm seem too thick? Are these are some of the constant worries whirling in your mind? The key to a healthy diet is to reduce fat intake. However, that's often easier said than done. Most fatty foods taste good and add to the richness and enjoyment of a meal. In spite of this, we should always keep in mind the hazards fatty foods can bring, and we can replace them with healthier ones. This should include an increase in complex carbohydrates and fiber intake (fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, legumes, grain products and rice). Complex carbohydrates are nutritious, tasty, contain much fewer calories, and satisfy hunger drive easily. Secondly, you must improve your eating habits. Many teens nowadays do not exercise very much and yet take in a lot of calories. For instance, when you get home, do you rip open a bag of cookies or potato chips as you plop in front of the TV? When you finish school, do you head for candy or soda machines? These habits pile on excess calories. Here are some tips for you to consider: "Do"s Eat slowly, giving your brain time to catch up with your stomach and tell you when you have already had enough to eat. When you feel hungry, chomp on something like a piece of carrot or celery. It soothes your hunger effectively, gives you valuable nutrients for almost no calories. Eat several small meals or nutritious snacks rather than one or two large meals a day. Larger meals encourage the formation of fat while smaller meals increase the release of extra energy as body heat. "Don't"s Don't heap up piles of food on your plate. Start with small portions instead. Go back for more only if you feel really hungry. Reduce the amount of condiments you add to food. Items like mayonnaise and catsup add lots of calories and salt that you don't really need. Eat in one place, not all over the house, in front of the TV, or while on the phone. Eating during other activities builds the habit of eating when you engage in those activities again, even if you are not hungry.

Avoid yo-yo dieting, periods of food restriction followed by gluttony. Instead, try to improve your diet Drink plenty of water with a meal and eat some high-fiber foods such as salads first. Water and fiber and see whether you can stick with that change permanently. help you feel full without having to pack away excess calories later. If you grocery shop for your family, do it on a full stomach. At home, keep problem foods out of sight and leave healthy foods visible and handy. If you know you're going to a party or social function, plan your eating strategy in advance. 1
