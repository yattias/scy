Endurance Diet
The aim of this diet is to provide adequate nutrition for training, recovery and competition for endurance sports such as long-distance swimming or running, cross-country skiing, competition tennis and triathlons where continuous activity is to be maintained for over 80 minutes. The ranges given in the following meal plan refer to an athletes between 55kg and 75kg. of body weight. Protein intake is based on 1.5g protein per kg body weight daily. Servings of bread, cereals, fruit and starchy vegetables can be varied to take into account overall energy needs depending on intensity and duration of training sessions. It is advisable to eat the protein servings as suggested and vary carbohydrate servings according to appetite. Monitor body weight weekly to check overall energy intake.

Diet Should Be HIGH in:
 COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES such as bread, rice, pasta, cereals, fruit and starchy vegetables. In fact, 55-60% of energy needs should come from carbohydrate foods since they are broken down into glucose which is the preferred energy source for working muscles. Additional servings of carbohydrates may be taken in the few days prior to an event to supersaturate the liver and muscles with glycogen (the storage form of glucose).  FLUIDS to keep the body well hydrated during and after training and competitions.

Diet Should Be LOW in:
 FATS and OILS, whether hidden in foods or added. A small intake of essential fat is necessary for good health, especially to aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. However, fat is not a preferred source of energy for working muscles, so it is best to choose low fat foods wherever possible and avoid adding fats in the form of butter, margarine, oils, cream, avocado and mayonnaise.

Diet Should Be MODERATE In:
 PROTEIN because endurance athletes do need increased servings of protein foods to ensure adequate recovery of muscles after exercise, but they generally do not need to consciously boost their protein intake with high protein foods or supplements. Simply eating greater amounts overall will usually take care of protein needs. The exception would be athletes who wish to lose body fat to "make weight" for a competition or for other reasons and who are reducing food intake overall. They should ensure a daily intake of ONE SERVING OF PROTEIN FOOD per 5-8kg body weight where one serving equals 30g meat, chicken or fish, one whole egg or 250ml low fat milk.

The FOOD Files: Sports Diets  FIBER because endurance athletes generally need to eat large quantities of food and high fiber foods are very filling. There is room for some lower fiber choices from the complex carbohydrate foods. Large amounts of vegetables are not necessary.

Sample Meal Plan
The following diet has been suggested for this condition.

Breakfast
 Two glasses of water when you wake up.  3-4 wheatflake biscuits or 2 cups corn flakes, puffed rice or Wheaties cereal with low fat milk (250ml) and 1-2 tsp. sugar (if desired) or 3-4 slices wholemeal toast with 1 egg, 30g cheese or sardines  Tomato or asparagus as desired.  One piece fresh fruit or 1/2 cup fruit juice  Weak tea, decaffeinated coffee or herbal tea with low fat milk

Morning Snack
 2 slices wholemeal bread, 1 English muffin, 2 crumpets with jam or honey, 1 slice of bread with a large banana or 1 date scone with jam  Two glasses water

Lunch
 3-4 slices wholemeal, grain or white bread, 1-2 rolls, 1-2 pocket breads or 1-1 1/2cups rice or noodles  60g chicken, lean ham, tuna, 2 eggs or 2 slices cheese  Salad vegetables as desired  One piece fresh fruit  Weak tea or coffee with low fat milk  Two glasses of water

Afternoon Snack
(preferably 2 to 2 1/2 hours before training)  2 slices wholemeal bread with jam or honey, 2 Weetbix with low fat milk and 1-2 tsp sugar (if desired), one salad sandwich or one banana sandwich (no butter)  30g cheese, 200g low fat yogurt or 250ml low fat milk with 1-2tsp flavoring (for 75kg person)  Two glasses of water

Dinner
(after training)  90-120g lean red meat or chicken, 180-240g grilled or poached fish, 3-4 low fat fish fillets, 2-3 eggs with 30g grated mozzarella cheese or 2-3 soybean patties or veggie burgers  2 medium potatoes or sweet potato with 1/2cup peas and corn, 2/3-1cup rice or pasta with 1/2cup peas or 3 bean salad or 2-4 slices bread  Carrot or pumpkin and green vegetables as desired 2

The FOOD Files: Sports Diets  One piece fresh fruit, 1 cup fruit salad or stewed fruit with 1/2-1cup low fat custard or yogurt  Two glasses of water

Dessert
 1-2 slices wholemeal bread or crumpets with jam or honey, 1-2 Weetbix with low fat milk or 250ml glass milk with 1-2tsp flavoring.

Daily Milk Intake
500ml low fat milk (Trim, HighLo, Shape)

Tips
 Spread food intake out over the day and allow time for digestion before training.  Increase bread and starch servings as needed to maintain body weight or to load glycogen for 2-3days before an event.  Drink water regularly throughout the day and evening.  Avoid fats and oils, fried foods, snack foods, etc.  Include some lower fiber starches when eating larger amounts.

Strength Diet
The aim of this diet is to provide adequate nutrition for training, recovery and competition for strength sports such as football, hockey, basketball and body-building. The ranges given in the following meal plan refer to an athletes between 75kg and 100kg of body weight. Protein intake is based on 1.5g protein per kg of body weight daily. Servings of bread, cereals, fruit and starchy vegetables can be varied to take into account overall energy needs depending on intensity and duration of training sessions. It is advisable to eat the protein servings as suggested and vary carbohydrate servings according to appetite. Monitor body weight weekly to check overall energy intake.

Diet Should Be HIGH In:
 COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES such as bread, rice, pasta, cereals, fruit and starchy vegetables. Every meal and snack should include some of these foods since they are broken down into glucose which is the preferred energy source for working muscles. Body-builders and others who wish to build muscle tend to over-emphasize protein foods at the expense of carbohydrates. Protein can be converted to glucose to be used as an energy source, but this is expensive metabolically and produces extra waste products for the kidneys to excrete.  FLUIDS to keep the body well hydrated during and after training and competitions and to aid elimination of waste products.

Diet Should Be LOW In:
 FATS and OILS, whether hidden in foods or added. A small intake of essential fat is necessary for good health, especially to aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. However, fat is not a preferred source of energy for working muscles, so it is best to choose low fat foods wherever possible and avoid adding fats in the form of butter, margarine, oils, cream, avocado and mayonnaise. 3

Diet Should Be MODERATE In:
 PROTEIN because athletes do need increased servings of protein foods to ensure adequate recovery and growth of muscles (in size or strength), but do not need large servings at the expense of carbohydrate foods. The timing of protein intake is more critical - small servings throughout the day to help control hunger and a larger serving soon after training (within 2 hours). Protein supplements are a convenient way to consume protein and carbohydrates in a readily useable form soon after training. Avoid large servings of protein closer than 3 hours before training or competition. Athletes who wish to lose body fat to "make weight" for a competition or other reasons should ensure a daily intake of ONE SERVING OF PROTEIN FOOD per 5-8kg body weight where one serving equals 30g meat, chicken or fish, 1 whole egg or 250ml low fat milk.  FIBER, because strength athletes may need to consume large quantities of food overall to maintain or increase body weight. Since high fiber foods are very filling, there is room for some lower fiber choices such as white bread, scones, muffins and fruit buns. Large amounts of vegetables are not necessary, but should be included in at least one meal daily.

Morning Snack
 2-3 slices wholemeal bread, 1-1 1/2 English muffins or 2-3 crumpets with jam or honey, 1-2 slices bread with a large banana or 1 date scone with jam  (for a 100kg athlete) 30g cheese or ham or 200g low fat yogurt  Two glasses of water
