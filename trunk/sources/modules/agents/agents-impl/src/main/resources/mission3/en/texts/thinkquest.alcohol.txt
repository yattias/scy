[ Effect on the Mind | Effect on the Heart | Effect on Blood Vessels | Effect on Sexual Organs ] Alcohol is commonly used at social functions. Alcohol is known for its effect of making people "high" enabling them to act without inhibition. But alcohol is also known for its disastrous effects. A large percentage of car accidents have been caused by alcohol. Alcohol can also lead to cirrhosis (damage of the liver), heart disease, stroke and cancer. If the concentration of alcohol in the blood is too high, it can cause death.

Effect on Mind
Alcohol is a depressant, giving us a sense of well-being and relief from stress and anxiety. Alcohol affects the neurons in our nervous system and decreases our mental performance. The reaction time of the brain is reduced. Vision is blurred, and judgement is clouded. Driving under the influence of alcohol leads to car accidents. For some, drinking alcohol also gives a misleading sense of confidence, reducing inhibitions. When some people are "drunk" they may "misbehave", shout vulgarities and insults, and tell people about their problems. Others may become sad and quiet, and some even just fall asleep.

MacDuff: What three things does drink especially provoke? Porter: . . . nose-painting, sleep, and urine. William Shakespeare (1564 1616)

Effect on the Heart
Alcohol reduces the ability of the heart to contract, causing it to work harder. Cardiomyeopathy may result. It is the enlargement and stretching of the heart, causing the valves to malfunction, allowing back flow of blood.

The FOOD Files: Alcohol Vasodilatation, the dilation of blood vessels in the skin, occurs under the influence of alcohol. This gives a false sense of warmth, but actually leads to a greater loss of body heat.

Effects on Sexual Organs
Alcohol is believed to increase sexuality but this is not true. Shakespeare wrote that alcohol "provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance." What Shakespeare wrote is true. Alcohol depresses inhibition, leading to sexual activities. But in men, alcohol reduces the ability to have an erection and delays or even prevents ejaculation. In women, sexual responsiveness is reduced. Alcohol causes atrophy (decreasing in size) of the testicles (male sex glands) which produce male hormones. It is the reduced production of the hormones which causes sterility.
