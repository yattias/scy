You can be a Source of Bacteria!
Poor personal hygiene and improper food handling will result in outbreaks of various food-borne diseases. Good food hygiene starts with the food handler.  Wash your hands and rinse them before preparing food, after handling raw food, in between handling different food items, and after using the toilet.  Don't sneeze or cough over food because it may introduce germs from your body into the food.  Don't touch your nose, hair or other parts of body when handling food.  Don't blow into food to cool it.  Don't smoke when handling food. Don't smoke at all if you're worried about your health!  Keep short and clean fingernails; don't wear nail polish while cooking or serving, as it may chip.  Don't handle food if you have cuts, sores, or boils on your hand. Cover open cuts, grazes, boils, and septic lesions with a clean waterproof bandage.  Avoid handling cooked food with your bare hands.  If you are suffering from diarrhea, fever or any other symptoms of a food-borne disease, do not handle food as you may be a source of contamination.

Keep your Kitchen Clean & Well-Ventilated
 Clean kitchen walls and floor daily, particularly in out of sight areas to remove food debris or grease from cooking.  Clean ceilings at least once a year.  Use equipment and working surfaces made of materials that are easily cleaned and non-reactive to food; e.g. stainless steel or plastics.  Do not use equipment made of metal because it can corrode.  Do not allow food to come into contact with untreated wooden surfaces.  Use synthetic, polypropylene, non-absorbent cutting boards.  If hard wooden chopping block is used, scrub it with water with detergent and disinfectant after every use.  Clean your oven and don't allow it to be coated with a layer of carbon, because it reduces heating ability.

Storage of Cleansers, Kitchenware, & Utensils
 Cover receptacles, utensils, crockery, and cutlery to protect them from dust.  Store pots and pans above the floor. Wash them before use if stored for a few days.  Use a knife rack that is detachable for cleaning.  Do not store knives in the space between the table and wall.  Store all utensils and equipment away from raw food.

Washing up of Crockery, Utensils, & Tableware
 Do not leave unclean articles in the sink for a long time. This will cause bacteria to grow and contaminate other food.  Scrape or wipe off food particles from the utensils.  Wash equipment and working surfaces with hot water and detergent.  Don't use water with temperatures higher than 150 Fahrenheit (65 Celsius).  Change washing and rinsing water as soon as it becomes dirty.  Dry cleaned utensils before storing.  Wash drying cloths frequently by boiling.  It's more hygienic to use disposable paper towels instead of cloth for drying utensils.

Pest Control
 Kill flies by spraying the refuse area to prevent breeding.  Use electrical fly killers as they don't provide any hazard associated with aerosol sprays.  Prevent pest's access to kitchen by having fly-proof windows, doors and ventilators.  Cover food.  Seal off crevices or holes which provide entrance for pests.
