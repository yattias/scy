 Region South Denmark has built Denmark’s first +low energy house

In August 2008, the first sod was turned symbolically at Prins Henriks Avenue in Sønderborg, where the so-called SIB ZERO+ house has been built – a house that produces more energy than it consumes.

The house has been constructed in a modern and exciting style – an individual building, well-adjusted to nature and surroundings, built with bricks like an ordinary family home. The first inhabitants are Mrs. Lone Midtgaard Wrang and Mr. Tom Toft Kragh with their three children.

Environment and energy awareness, modern consumer behaviour – these are the keywords in a showcase project which the following companies in Sønderborg have been participating in: ProjectZero, the building and construction company SIB Byggeri, Grontmij|Carl Bro, Danfoss and the energy supplier SYD ENERGI.

The house is now ready-built, and we can see many advantages for future housing, especially for dedicated house owners who want to show responsibility in connection with both environment and society, said Torben Golles from SIB.

The house has been named SIB ZERO+, because it can produce energy for both its inhabitants and their neighbours, so to speak.

The house can practically make your electricity meter run backwards when there is an energy surplus from the solar device which is connected to the mains supply, Conny Stjernholm, CEO for SYD ENERGI’s marketing division said. Department manager Christian Udby, Grontmij|Carl Bro, agreed, saying that the biggest challenge lies in the inhabitants’ behaviour.

The question is whether the whole project is profitable, regarding consumption and maintenance, and whether the inhabitant family can live in an energy sustainable way without making any sacrifices regarding their standard of living.

- Knowledge sources and all the important local players have been united to create Denmark’s first +low energy house for families who are interested in both energy efficiency, intelligent energy management and correct consumer behaviour, Christian Udby said.

The project wants to visualize the profitability in low energy-, passive- and plus housing versus ordinary housing projects. The costs for building and construction will be compared to the costs for energy consumption. The companies SIB Byggeri and Grontmij|Carl Bro were responsible for planning and carrying out the project.


Facts about the house


• The SIB ZERO+ low energy house represents a housing form of the future, which on an annual basis can create a small surplus of renewable energy compared to the energy consumed within the building frame – regarding both electricity, heating and water.
• The aim is to make the house CO2 neutral via one or several devices for renewable energy supply, and to show what in the near future can become profitable.
• Up till now, only low energy- and passive houses have been built. Now, however, we have created a unique product - the SIB ZERO+ house, which on an annual basis is 100 percent self-sufficient with renewable energy. Our aim is to create a house which, built repeatedly, can become economically neutral regarding the so-called passive house part of the project.
• The house has a living space of 180 m2, it is well-built and comfortable. A combination of well known technologies brings energy consumption down to the lowest possible level. It is Denmark’s first +house
• The foundation stone for the whole planning process is a close cooperation combining energy and architecture with all the demands for a modern home. Thus, the project fulfils the ordinary citizen’s needs and wishes, creating an energy sustainable and environmentally friendly family home.
