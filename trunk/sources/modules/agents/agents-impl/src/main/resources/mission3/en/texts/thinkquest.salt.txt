[ Salty Food | Tasty Food Without Salt | Trouble with Salt ] Salt is the common name for the chemical sodium chloride. It is necessary for the healthy functioning of the body. Salt provides us with sodium and chloride. But too much salt will lead to high blood pressure, which in turn leads to strokes, heart attacks and kidney failure.

Salty Food
We take in sodium when we add MSG (monosodium glutamate)/chili/soy sauce and other sauces, or consume processed food. Most preserved or processed foods contain salt. They include barbecued meat, luncheon meat, sausages, smoked fish, pickles of all kinds, cheese, commercial seasoning such as soup cubes and vegetable extracts, ham, bacon, and bottled tomato and chili sauce. Salted fish, vegetables, eggs and soy sauce all contain salt. Check food labels to see how much salt the food contains. When possible, choose fresh ingredients for cooking and also food labeled "low salt", "low sodium", "reduced salt" or "no salt added". Isotonic (sports) drinks also contain a lot of salt, so do not take them unless you are working out very hard.

Tasty Food Without Salt
We have eaten salt for years, and food without added salt may taste a bit unusual, but we can still get used to the natural taste of the dishes we eat. In place of salt, we can use other fresh herbs for seasonings, such as ginger, garlic, onions and spices. Avoid over-cooking, especially when you are stewing or boiling, and do not prick meat or fish. This will release the natural salts in them and you may have the tendency to add more salt to compensate. It's best to taste any food before adding salt to it. Chances are that you will find it salty already.

Trouble with Salt
It is sodium in the salt that acts like a sponge, holding water in our bodies. This makes our blood volume expand, which raises the pressure in our veins and arteries. This increased blood pressure can lead to stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Effects Illness Linked to Salt
