Batavia: the Zero Carbon House

 

 

Project Aim

 

To pilot an approach to carbon-neutral living that can be replicated across the UK and elsewhere.

 

 

Objectives

 

1.  To contruct a highly efficient, low embodied energy house on Unst, Shetland.

2.  To install a low carbon energy system compromising two micro wind turbines, an electric car, an air to water heat pump, watery battery heat store, power store and control system.

3.  To erect a high technology greenhouse for local food production.

4.  To establish a viable business promoting low carbon living, supplying local, carbon-neutral food and managing an electric vechicle for community use.

5.  To monitor performance of the energy system in real time, using students on placements staying in the house to experience zero carbon living, and expert consultants.

6.  To disseminate the results of the project across Shetland, Scotland, UK and internationally through a variety of media including film, World Wide Web, talks and visits.

 

 

Project Characteristics

 

Technical risk is minimised by use of familiar robust technologies from well respected Scottish, UK and international manufacturers and suppliers.

 

Integration of an air-to-water heat pump, hot water battery and underfloor heating with an innovative domestic hot water system.

 

Financial exposure of any one party minimised by holistic demonstration of the system on a small scale that can attract a range of financial partners to learn together.

 

Design risk minimised through use of expert partners (ESD, Scotframe, etc.)

 

Strong partnerships with a range of local, national and international organisations.

 

Contruction period near completion January 2008.

 

 

Projected Outcomes

 

Pilot of integrated approach to low carbon living that can be replicated across the UK and elsewhere.

 

Demonstration of micro generation technologies to power house, transport and food production.

 

Development of market for micro generation in Highlands and Islands by demonstrating a system that can be implemented on remote grids and "unplugged" if required.

 

Demonstration of Re-fuel cell power storage system in a domestic/light commercial intelligent, integrated system for carbon neutral living.

 

Integration of social, economic and environmental agendas through supporting local food production business, low carbon community transport and low carbon housing.

 

Addressing fuel poverty-in housing and transport in rural deprived urban areas, with reference to private, council and housing association developments.
