Energy Efficiency

Every home that is marketed for sale must have an EPC Energy Performance Certificate as part of a HIP (Home Information Pack), which details a home’s energy efficiency. In order to issue a certificate it is necessary to conduct a survey of the property either by a qualified DEA (Domestic Energy Assessor) or a Home Inspector (HI). From October 2008 an EPC is required for rental property by property owners who wish to let their property.

Rented Property EPC - more information relevant to the private landlord.

Landlords EPC - If you have a rented property and are a private landlord you will require to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for your property. Find out how & when this will affect the homes for rent & lettings sector for Landlords Energy Performance Certificates.
Lettings EPC - EPC for Property Lettings and Rented accommodation will require Energy Certificates in 2008, find out how an inspection affects the private landlord. See also EPC Lettings for the rented property sector.


Whether you are a home seller, and in future, conduct property lettings, you must have a valid Energy Performance Certificate when you sell your home, or let your home. We have compiled a register of independent accredited EPC providers who are licensed to carry out EPC Surveys, a listing is provided below, you can select to find a EPC provider in your local area.

An EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) provides a rating for your home in its present condition and also a rating for its potential if certain energy saving improvements are undertaken. The overall assessment is based on a sliding scale of A to F, where A is the highest level (i.e. most efficient) and G (less efficient). To simplify the rating scales a similar method to that used for home appliances (e.g. fridges, freezers etc) was adopted.

Who can issue a Domestic Energy Assessment?

A qualified Domestic Energy Assessor is responsible for the issue of and EPC or Energy Performance Certificate for Domestic premises and in the case of a Commercial EPC a qualified Commercial Buildings Assessor.

EPC Data Collectors

Under recent guidelines from CLG (Communities and Local Government) a qualified Domestic Energy Assessor must visit the premises to ensure that the data and fulfilments of the EPC are met. Otherwise the EPC will be invalid. This validity also applies to Commercial & Landlord and Rented premises. A data collector for domestic properties or commercial properties cannot issue an Energy Performance Certificate for your property. Check that the assessor visiting your premises is authorised to issue your Energy Certificate.

Typical ratings are shown below for home assessment.

EPC Ratings


There are many factors to consider when calculating the ratings for an EPC for every home, as each house is different.

	

The basic criteria for energy assessment include:

Building Construction
Age of construction
Number of windows and type
Volumetric calculation of all floors
Method of heating and controls used
Levels of insulation (lofts and walls)
Thermal properties of adjacent buildings
Heat losses
Fixed lighting efficiency
Renewable energy sources i.e. solar panels, domestic wind turbines for example.
The factors detailed above are noted, and, using computer software an overall rating can be obtained, together with recommendations for improvement where required.

Once completed, the EPC can be delivered to the homeowner, and/or, their representative, for inclusion in the home information pack (HIP). A unique reference number is applied to every Energy Certificate and the assessor can supply a web address so that you can view your EPC online. Remember it is better to instruct a local independent domestic energy assessor, the energy certificate remains your property, as you purchased it, therefore you own it. If you instruct an estate agent to act on your behalf to compile your Home Information Pack, the same rule applies. Instruct an independent Home Pack Provider, this will ensure that all the documentation belongs to you - the home seller. A listing of independent providers is available, refer to Home Information Packs.

How long is an EPC valid for?

The EPC is valid for as long as the new homeowner remains in the property before moving again, or in the case of the same property coming back on the market again in the future, then another assessment would be required, commercial buildings certificates, and  private rented property and accommodation, are valid for 10 years from the date of the original 's EPC inception date, more information about Commercial Buildings Energy Assessment and how this will affect property managers.

Landlords and Tenants

Currently a landlord who rents a property to a tenant can voluntarily carry out an assessment for the production of an EPC on the property that they own.

	

From October 2008 it will be mandatory for an assessor to conduct a survey of the rented property for the production of an EPC. 

The landlord/owner of the property would bear the cost of the EPC. Estimates suggest that there are approx. 2.5 million homes in the rental sector which would be affected by this legislation.

When buildings are to be rented out, the landlord is responsible for ensuring a valid certificate is made available to all prospective tenants.

Validity & Issue Of Certificates

When the construction of a new building is completed, the builder or person responsible for the construction is responsible for obtaining the certificate and providing it to the owner.

An Energy Performance Certificate is only required when a building is constructed, sold or rented out. An EPC is valid for 10 years, except for sales of homes which are subject to the Home Information Pack. The EPC and recommendation report must be made available free of charge by the seller or a landlord to a prospective buyer or tenant at the earliest opportunity and no later than:

When any written information about the building is provided in response to a request for information received from the prospective buyer; or when a viewing is conducted; or

If neither of those occur, before entering into a contract to sell or let.

An energy performance certificate does not have to be made available if:

The seller believes that the prospective buyer or tenant is unlikely to have sufficient funds to purchase or rent the property or is not genuinely interested in buying or renting that type of property; or

The seller or landlord is unlikely to be prepared to sell or rent out the property to the prospective buyer or tenant.

In addition, please refer to EPC Frequently Asked Questions FAQs relating to Social Housing, Student Housing & Accommodation, and Housing in Multiple Occupation as a Guide to whether an EPC is required to be produced. For all other cases an EPC will almost certainly be required.

Timescale

Homes will require an EPC on rent from 1 October 2008.
Commercial buildings > 10000m2 will require an EPC on rent from 6 April 2008 and all remaining commercial buildings will require an EPC on rent from 1 October 2008.

Some types of property are exempt from HIPs and EPC’s see HIP Exemptions.
