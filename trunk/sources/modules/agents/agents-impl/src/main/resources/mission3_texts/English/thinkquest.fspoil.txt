Appearance of Spoiled Canned Foods
Normal Canned Food
A normal can looks slightly concave or flat at both sides.

Spoiled Canned Food
Spoiled canned food can be detected by observing the appearance of the cans themselves: 1. Hard Swell Cans have bulging ends due to the pressure inside the can produced by gases resulting from microbial or chemical reaction. They are permanently distended. 2. Soft Swell Cans have ends that can be moved by thumb pressure but cannot be forced back into normal position. 3. Springers are cans in which one end bulges. Upon forcing this end back into the normal position, the opposite end bulges out. 4. Flippers appear normal but one of the ends "flip" out when the can is struck against a solid object; the end snaps back to the normal position when very light pressure is applied. 5. Rusty cans 6. Deformed cans, with marked deformed seams. Canned food can be contaminated after the can has been opened. So after opening a can of food, transfer the food into a plastic container and store it in a refrigerator if you do not intend to eat it immediately.
