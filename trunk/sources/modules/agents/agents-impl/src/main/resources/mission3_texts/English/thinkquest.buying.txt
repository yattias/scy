"Don't"s Never buy from illegal hawkers

Read Labels Carefully
 When choosing pre-packaged foods, you should read the labels on the items carefully.  Look out for misleading food names. For instance, you must look at the list of ingredients to make sure that you are buying what the name says. If the product "fruit jelly" does not have the fruit indicated on the ingredients list, it should not be called fruit jelly.  Check the expiration date on the labels and make sure you have enough time for consumption of the food before buying.  Claims that the food contains vitamins or minerals must be substantiated with supporting information on the label.

The FOOD Files: Buying Food  It may seem negligible, but itis actually important that you plan your shopping beforehand.  Buy goods off the shelves first and perishable food (pasteurized milk, meat, poultry, and fish) which requires refrigeration or freezing last.  Make sure you return home as soon as possible and place the perishables in the refrigerator; do not leave them in heat.

Buy the Correct Quantity
 Do not buy more perishable food than can be stored in your fridge and freezer.  Buy perishable food (raw and cooked meat, milk, cream, fish) in quantities suitable for the size of your family to avoid throwing away spoiled left-overs.  Buy non-perishable food also in reasonable quantities (dry goods, preserves and canned foods). Do not buy more than a few week's supply.
