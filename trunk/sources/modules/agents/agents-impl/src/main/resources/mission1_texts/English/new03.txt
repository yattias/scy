Global warming 1
Most people nowadays refer to the greenhouse effect as the cause of global climate change. It is also well known that greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) that is released in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, are to blame for global warming. However, few people know that the greenhouse effect has not started just after the industrial revolution. The greenhouse effect did not originate from human activities but it has always been a natural process. 

About one-third of the solar energy that reaches the upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere is reflected back to space. The rest is warming the surface of the Earth, which emits infrared radiation back to the atmosphere. Naturally occurring gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have the capacity to absorb part of this infrared radiation, which causes the greenhouse effect (Figure 1). 

The phenomenon has been named after the analogous process that involves the glass walls in a greenhouse. Without the naturally occurring greenhouse effect, the Earth’s average temperature would be around -18°C. It is due to this effect that the average temperature on Earth is maintained at about 15oC. Therefore, the greenhouse effect is a natural process that helps to reach the Earth's surface to the temperatures necessary to support life. 

The greenhouse effect acts in about the same way as car windows on a sunny day (Figure 2). They do allow the sun to heat up the car, but prevent the heat from escaping. This is why the inside of a car is much warmer than the air outside. 

Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, have greatly intensified the natural greenhouse effect, causing global warming. Since burning of fossil fuels after the industrial revolution accelerated the pace by which carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are concentrated in the atmosphere (Figure 3), the amount of infrared radiation captured by greenhouse gases is also increased, which leads to an overall increase of the Earth’s mean temperature (Figure 4). We are probably familiar with melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels. Other such impacts refer to changes to weather patterns, which are predicted to reduce agricultural productivity. Scientists claim that even a small rise of the temperature can have detrimental environmental impacts. There are scientific reports claiming that if the Earth’s mean temperature increases more than 2°C, irreversible damage could occur to many ecosystems throughout the world. 

The rate of global warming will depend on various feedback mechanisms. For example, as the atmosphere gets warmer, the concentration of water vapor increases, further intensifying the greenhouse effect. This in turn causes more warming, which eventuates in a further increase in water vapor. This self-reinforcing cycle may double the increase in the greenhouse effect due to the added CO2 alone.

Very often people confuse the greenhouse effect with ozone depletion. However, these are two different phenomena. Despite the fact that ozone (O3) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are greenhouse gases, the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion are distinct phenomena. Ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs most harmful ultraviolet light in sun’s radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons destroy the molecule of ozone and make its layer thinner. There are international agreements in force, according to which all nations are obliged to reduce ozone-destroying chemicals to let the ozone layer eventually recover. Scientists monitor the ozone ‘hole’ over the Antarctic (Figure 5) as well as depletions occurring in the Arctic.

Glossary of terms

Atmosphere
The atmosphere comprises a set of gases arranged in various layers surrounding Earth. The atmosphere is composed by nitrogen (78.08%), oxygen (20.95%), argon (0.93%), carbon dioxide (0.038%), and trace amounts of other gases. The atmosphere supports life on Earth by increasing Earth’s mean surface temperature, reducing temperature oscillations between day and night, and absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation.

Ecosystem
An ecosystem is an integrated whole of biotic and abiotic factors, which are defined for a chosen place referent. A lake, a river watershed, a forest, a coastal zone, all these are examples of an ecosystem. In each case, biotic factors involve characteristic flora and fauna, together addressed as biodiversity. The latter tern reflects not only the number of different species found in an ecosystem, but also their relative abundance and the relationships they engage in, for instance food webs. Abiotic factors in an ecosystem can be studied as gradients, which influence the activity of animals and plants. For example, temperature and humidity form such gradients. 

Infrared radiation
The sun radiates vast quantities of energy into space, across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Most of this energy is concentrated in the visible and near-visible parts of the spectrum. The narrow band of visible light represents about 43% of the total radiant energy emitted by the sun. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more energy it contains. Thus, ultraviolet light is capable of breaking apart stable biological molecules and causing sunburn and skin cancers. The remaining 49 - 50% of the radiant energy is spread over the wavelengths longer than those of visible light. These lie in the near infrared range, the thermal infrared, and the far infrared regions. Although the atmosphere is transparent to visible light, various components of earth's atmosphere absorb ultraviolet and infrared solar radiation.

Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, which have been formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. Fossil fuels are found in deposits beneath the earth. The fuels are made of hydrocarbons. When fossil fuels are burned, they release the chemical energy that is stored in the atomic bonds of hydrocarbons. In 2006, it was estimated that fossil fuels amounted to an 86% share in primary energy production all over the world. Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being formed. 

Greenhouse gases
Gases in the Earth’s atmosphere which absorb and emit radiation within the thermal infrared range are termed greenhouse gases. They have been given this name due to their fundamental role in the production of the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the greenhouse gas that has accumulated the most in the atmosphere and has the greatest cumulative effect on global warming. Human sources of carbon dioxide primarily include the burning of fossil fuels, namely, coal, oil, and natural gas, and deforestation. Methane (CH4) is emitted by agricultural activities, ranching, landfills, and energy exploration. Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is produced by the use of nitrogen fertilizers, nylon production, and the burning of organic material and fossil fuels. Tropospheric ozone (O3) is created by the reaction of sunlight with human-produced pollutants from vehicles and power plants. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are synthetic chemicals used in the manufacture of aerosol sprays and as solvents, refrigerants, and blowing agents for foams and packing materials. Freon is a common CFC used in refrigerators. In the upper atmosphere, CFCs not only trap heat, but also destroy the ozone layer. The 1987 Montreal Protocol established a schedule to scale back the production of CFCs, and a 1990 amendment banned further production of these chemicals entirely. All greenhouse gases, aside from the halocarbons, are also produced by natural processes. It is their rapid concentration in the atmosphere over the past few centuries due to human action that has led to global warming.

Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution marked a turning point in human history. It has taken place in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transportation exerted a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions across the globe. In the latter part of the 18th century there was a shift in Great Britain's manual labor and draft animal–based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. This transition involved the mechanization of the textile industries. Further, trade expanded by the introduction of railways. The introduction of steam power fuelled by coal led to sharp increases in production capacity. These changes subsequently spread throughout Europe, North America, and eventually all over the world.
