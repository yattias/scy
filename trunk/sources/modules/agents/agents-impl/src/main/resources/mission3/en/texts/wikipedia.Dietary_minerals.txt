Dietary mineral - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Dietary mineral
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Â Â (Redirected from Dietary minerals) Jump to: navigation, search Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen present in common organic molecules. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent of the definition is to describe chemical elements, not chemical compounds or actual minerals. Examples include calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and iodine. Dietitians may recommend that dietary elements are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the chemical element(s) of interest. The elements may be naturally present in the food (e.g., calcium in dairy milk) or added to the food (e.g., orange juice fortified with calcium; iodized salt, salt fortified with iodine). Dietary supplements can be formulated to contain several different chemical elements (as compounds), a combination of vitamins and/or other chemical compounds, or a single element (as a compound or mixture of compounds), such as calcium (as carbonate, citrate, etc.) or magnesium (as oxide, etc.), chromium (usually as picolinate). The dietary focus on chemical elements derives from an interest in supporting the biochemical reactions of metabolism with the required elemental components.[1] Appropriate intake levels of certain chemical elements have been demonstrated to be required to maintain optimal health. Diet can meet all the body's chemical element requirements, although supplements can be used when some requirements (e.g., calcium, which is found mainly in dairy products) are not adequately met by the diet, or when chronic or acute deficiencies arise from pathology, injury, etc.

[edit] Essential chemical elements
Some sources state that sixteen chemical elements are required to support human biochemical processes by serving structural and functional roles as well as electrolytes:[2] Most of the dietary elements are of relatively low atomic weight: Periodic table highlighting dietary elements H Li Na K Rb Cs He Ne Ar Kr Xe Rn 1

[edit] Other elements
Many elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function. One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive, so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce.[1] Element Sulfur Cobalt Description Excess [6] as Relatively large quantities of sulfur are required, but there is no RDA, (primarily the sulfur is obtained from and used for amino acids, and therefore should be associated with adequate in any diet containing enough protein. compounds) Cobalt poisoning 3

[edit] Other elements

Dietary mineral - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Cobalt is required in the synthesis of vitamin B12, but because bacteria are required to synthesize the vitamin, it is usually considered part of vitamin B12 deficiency rather than its own dietary element deficiency. There have been occasional studies asserting the essentiality of nickel,[7] but Nickel it currently has no known RDA. Chromium is sometimes described as essential.[8][9] It is implicated in sugar metabolism in humans, leading to a market for the supplement chromium Chromium picolinate, but definitive biochemical evidence for a physiological function is lacking.[10] Fluorine (as fluoride) has been described as conditionally essential, Fluorine depending upon the importance placed upon the prevention of chronic disease.[11][12] Boron has been found to be essential for the utilization of vitamin D and Boron calcium in the body.[13] Arsenic, bromine, cadmium, silicon, tungsten, and vanadium have established, albeit specialized, biochemical roles as structural or functional Other cofactors in other organisms. These elements appear not to be utilized by humans.[citation needed]
