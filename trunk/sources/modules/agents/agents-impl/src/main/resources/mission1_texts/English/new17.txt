Welcome to Light House Sustainable Building Centre

Light House Sustainable Building Centre is an enterprising non-profit society dedicated to advancing and catalyzing sustainability in British Columbia's built environment. We offer a range of free and fee-based programs and services out of our 1,300 square foot office, resource and display centre on Granville Island.

Our mission is to:

    * Provide a "first-stop" integrated service shop that connects British Columbians with the inspiration, information, services and skills they need to implement sustainable building solutions.
    * Provide education, training and outreach programs that will foster a deeper awareness of and commitment to sustainable building practices
    * Support and advance public sector programs and private sector initiatives through community engagement, research, partnership development, technical assistance and consulting services.
    * Facilitate and accelerate market transformation and economic development activities for the sustainable building cluster in British Columbia


Anyone and everyone - industry professionals, building owners, government representatives and members of the general public - can come to learn about the "five Ps" of sustainable building: practices, policies, products, projects and service providers. Guests are invited to relax in our comfortable modern environment, explore and discuss the latest eco friendly or "green" resources and find the solutions they need to make their buildings, houses, communities and lives more sustainable.
