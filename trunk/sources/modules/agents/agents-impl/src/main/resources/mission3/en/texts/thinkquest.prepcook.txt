Preventing Contamination
"Do"s Keep all food contact surfaces clean at all times Keep food covered to protect against pests and dirt Don't use wooden cutting boards Separate raw and cooked food at all stages of preparation Don't use the same knife to cut different Keep thawing food away from all food as thawing liquid may foods without first thoroughly washing it contaminate other food Use separate chopping boards for handling cooked and uncooked food. If only one board is available, clean it often Wash knives, tongs and other utensils and appliances before and after handling food Discard chipped, cracked or open-seamed pans and containers

"Don't"s Don't use defective or unwashed appliances or utensils for handling food

Thawing Frozen Food
 Frozen food such as vegetables, fish fingers, hamburgers, steaks, and chops can be cooked, fried or grilled directly from a frozen state. They are generally small, and can be thoroughly cooked in a short time.  Large cuts of meat, meat on bones, and poultry must be thawed completely prior to cooking. This is to ensure that all parts of the food are adequately cooked.  Frozen foods are best thawed in the refrigerator, if time allows. To thaw frozen food more quickly, without the use of a microwave oven, unwrap and put it under cold, running water or leave it wrapped and soak it in cold water.  Thawed food should not be refrozen, especially when thawing is done without proper temperature control. Bacteria will grow during the thawing and refreezing of food.  Thawed food that has not been cooked must not be stored in the refrigerator for later consumption; throw it away.  You can refreeze food after cooking.

Microwave Ovens
The microwave oven has by now become a quite commonly used home appliance. It is a device which cooks food by radiation and uses microwaves (a form of light energy) to generate the heat energy required. Heat is generated from within the food and therefore there is no browning and crusting on the surface of the food. Note:  Metal containers and aluminum foils are not suitable for use in microwave cooking  Porcelain, glass, paper, and stoneware without gold edging and patterns may be used

Why are Microwave Ovens Helpful?
 Cooking time is short  Little labor is required  Microwave cooking destroys germs to a level safe as that achieved by conventional cooking There are no adverse side effects from eating microwaved food. However, food cooked in a microwave oven may look less appetizing. When microwaving food, you also run the risk of losing the nutrients in the food by overcooking. However, when food is properly prepared, the short cooking time and little use of added water or oil usually retains nutrients better than boiling or frying.

Safety Precautions for Microwave Cooking
 Don't place metal containers or substances inside the oven.  Clean the interior and the door of the oven with a slightly wet cloth or mild detergent that will not scratch the surface.  Don't use an oven with damaged interlocks, hinges, latches, sealing surfaces or door.  Keep door seal free from food residues.  Close door properly before cooking.  Don't stand near the oven while it is in operation.  Cover the food loosely while cooking. This is to prevent splattering and excessive loss of moisture.

The FOOD Files: Preparing & Cooking Food Fact: The egg yolk of a hard-cooked egg sometimes turns blackish when sulfur from the egg white and iron from the yolk combine to form iron sulfide. However, this compound is harmless and the egg is still safe for consumption. The black color can be reduced by placing the hard-cooked egg in cold water immediately after cooking.

Meat & Poultry
 Do not handle raw intestines and liver together with raw and cooked meat or poultry.  Cut larger joints of meat into smaller pieces so that it can be thoroughly cooked.  Make sure that meat and poultry are cooked thoroughly.  Don't just "warm up" left-over meat dishes. Cook a left-over meat dish thoroughly by bringing it quickly to the boiling point and consume it while it is hot.

Rice
 Cool rice or rice dishes quickly if not consumed immediately, and store in a refrigerator.  Cold rice, when heated, must be heated up quickly and thoroughly, and served as soon as possible.

Vegetables
 If raw vegetables are to be eaten, consider washing them in water containing a solution of sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 60 to 80 parts per million for at least 30 seconds to kill germs.  Wash the vegetables thoroughly, rinsing under a tap for at least 1 minute.  Washing can be done in a basin of water, but you should change the water between vegetables.  Use lukewarm water to clean vegetables, as it has a better cleansing effect than cold water.  In the case of celery and potatoes, use a vegetable brush to clean the surface of these vegetables.  Vegetables may be cooked by baking, boiling, steaming and stir-frying.
