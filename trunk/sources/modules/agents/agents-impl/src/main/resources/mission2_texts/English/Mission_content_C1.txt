Topic: C1 The concept of pH and changes of pH 

1) Problem presentation 
  Kevin  and  Anna  have  been  penfriends  several  years.  Anna  lives  in  Sweden  and  Kevin  in  Estonia.  Estonia  is  known  for  its  limestone  banks.  Also,  national  Estonian  stone  is  limestone.  During  her  summer  vacation  Anna  was  visiting  Kevin  in  Estonia.  Buddies  decided  to  go  trout  fishing  to  a  lake  near  the  home  village.  On  their  way  to  the  lake,  Anna  told  Kevin  that  there  were  some  lakes  in  Sweden with transparent pure water and beautiful granite stones on bottom, but no fish  that was  due to acid rain. Anna was curious if there was no acid rain in Estonia. Kevin said that they did have  acid  rain  in  Estonia,  like  in  other  countries.  Anna  was  really  surprised.  How  was  this  possible?  Shouldn't the acidic precipitation inhibit the fish spawning? Kevin started thinking about it. Indeed,  how could trout survive despite of acid rain?

2) Tasks for the student for formulating a problem 
  Now you have read the story about Kevin and Anna, who are puzzled about why acid rain does not  have the same effect on aquatic life in Estonia as they do in Sweden. Acidification of water bodies  due to acid rain has been linked to disappearance of fish not only in Sweden, but also in Norway and  Scotland. Whereas there were no evidence of such impact further south in Europe, although inputs  of acid rain being higher than in Scandinavia. Your task is to find out the reasons why acid rain raises  the acidity of water in some countries, whereas in other countries pH of water bodies remains stable  despite  of  acid  rain.  Firstly,  you  should  do  some  additional  reading  (link  to  list  of  websites  and  background information). Secondly, you should formulate the problem in your own words, using the  knowledge you received from your additional reading.    Problem:   Why does acid rain cause a vast decline of pH value in water bodies of some countries, while in other  countries it does not have a similar effect? 

 
 

3) Tasks for the student for formulating research questions 
  Now you have read the additional information and know a bit more about acid rain and its influence  on  aquatic  life  in  case  of  different  composition  of  bottom  materials  of  water  bodies.  Soon  you  are  going to perform an experiment using mobile devices in order to find out how acid rain can change  pH of water and, also, how different ground types influence pH of water. But prior to that you should  formulate two or three research questions.  Here are some advices:   A good research question should be neither too broad nor too narrow;   Find a question that appears to be feasible using available resources (time, equipment, etc.);    A  good  research  question  contains  one  independent  factor  and  one  dependent  factor  plus  it  specifies relation between them. E.g. How does Factor X influence Factor Z?    Try  to  avoid  dichotomous  questions  with  simple  yes  or  no  answers  ­  these  don't  make  good  research questions. Better use open questions.    Research questions:   · ·     How does pH of water depend on different types of ground?  How does added acid influence pH of water with different types of ground? 

4) Tasks for the student for formulating hypotheses 
  Now  you  have  formulated  research  questions.  In  writing  the  research  questions  you  probably  had  some  assumptions  of  what  the  answers  could  be.  These  assumptions  are  also  called  hypotheses. 

Your  next  task  is  to  formulate  one  hypothesis  for  each  research  question.  A  hypothesis  is  a  statement, which usually has an "if ..., then ..." structure.    Hypotheses:  · ·     If the salts in ground dissolve in water, then they can influence pH of water.  Added  acid  has  a  minimized  or  no  effect  on  pH  of  water  with  ground  containing  salts  that  give alkaline reaction in water.

  6) Background theory about the topic 
  The topic of the concept of pH and changes of pH focuses on the importance of preserving a stable  pH in aquatic ecosystems.    pH is a logarithmic measure of the effective concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, pH = log  [H+]. pH is a measure of the acidity (or basicity) of a solution, where values of 0 to 14 are possible.  Acidic solutions have a pH < 7. E.g. pH value of urine is around 6, orange juice around 3 and lemon  juice around 2. Alkaline (also called basic) solutions have pH > 7. E.g. pH in solution of baking soda is  9,  soapy  water  is  12  and  bleach  is  13.  Neutral  solutions  have  pH  =  7.  High  acidity  or  alkalinity  can  cause direct physical damage to skin, gills and eyes of fish. If wide pH swings were to occur in ponds,  lakes  and  the  seas,  for  various  biochemical  reasons,  fish  and  other  organisms  would  not  survive.  Changes  in  pH  affect  the  toxicity  of  many  dissolved  compounds.  For  example,  ammonia  becomes  more toxic as pH increases.   

  Figure 2. The pH scale.  (Figure obtained from  http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/184ph.html)     Special indicators are used to measure pH of solutions. pH indicators are substances that undergo a  sharp, easily observable colour change when pH of a solution changes. Commonly used indicators are  methyl orange and phenolphthalein.  pH value can be roughly and quickly measured with pH paper strips, which change colour depending  on pH value in a solution. E.g. litmus paper turns red if environment in a solution is acidic and it turns  blue if environment is basic. The colour of litmus paper does not change if a solution is neutral. Using  pH strips is convenient and simple. A strip is submerged in the solution of interest and the reading of  pH is done by comparing/matching the colour of the strip with the colour range on the package.

(Figure obtained from http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/acids/acids.htm)     In order to measure pH more precisely you need to apply a pH meter. pH meter consists of a special  electrode which is connected to electronic equipment ­ a meter that displays the pH reading. At the  time of their invention, pH meters could be used only in lab conditions. Nowadays a pH sensor can be  connected to a portable mobile device or a laptop and measurements can be done on the spot, so  that there is no need to collect the samples and transport them to the lab.   

  Figure  4.  A  Vernier  pH  sensor  connected  to  a  mobile  device.  (Figure  obtained  from  http://21ctl.fi.ncsu.edu/msms/pH_lab.html)   As it was said earlier, serious fluctuations of pH in aquatic ecosystems can cause severe damage to  organisms living there. One factor which lowers the pH of water bodies is acid rain.  The term `acid  rain'  refers  to  any  form  of  precipitation  such  as  rain,  fog,  snow  or  hail  which  contains  nitric  and  sulphuric  acids.  These  acids  form  in  air  from  nitrogen  and  sulphur  oxides  emitted  by  industry,  transportation and power plants.   Aquatic  organisms  require  the  pH  of  water  to  be  within  an  optimal  range  in  order  to  grow  and  survive. Most of aquatic organisms prefer pH ranging 6.5 ­ 8.0.  Outside of this range reproduction  can  suffer  and  species  even  extinct  if  the  pH  is  differing  greatly  from  the  values  optimal  for  their  growth.  In  addition  to  that,  low  pH  can  cause  the  release  of  toxic  metals  and  compounds  from 

sediments  into  the  water.  Changes  in  pH  also  have  influence  on  the  availability  of  plant  nutrients  (phosphate, ammonia, iron).    Depending  on  the  area's  bedrock  and  bottom  material,  different  water  bodies  have  different  resistance to the harmful effects of acid precipitation. The pH level of a river or lake is maintained at  a stable level thanks to special buffering chemical compounds in the water. This resistance of water  to changes in pH is thus called buffering capacity. Waters with good buffering capacity contain such  compounds  as  hydrogen  carbonates  (also  called  bicarbonates),  carbonates  and  hydroxides  which  neutralize hydrogen ions coming with acidic precipitation thereby raising pH of the water.   If bedrock and bottom material of water bodies in a given location has mainly granite in them, then  the  buffering  capacity  of  water  in  such  areas  is  low  to  none,  so  that  if  acid  is  added  to  a  lake,  it  immediately changes the pH in the lake.   In case of bedrocks and bottom material contain limestone, the buffering capacity is very good and  the harmful effect of acidification cause by acid rain is minimized. In areas with limestone bedrock  the waters have a higher alkalinity and such a situation is preferable for preserving a stable pH. High  alkalinity  enables  the  water  body  to  neutralize  acidic  pollution  from  precipitation  or  from  wastewater.    One concept closely related to the buffering activity is water hardness. Water hardness is defined as  reluctance  of  water  to  produce  lather  with  soap,  due  to  various  dissolved  salts,  mainly  salts  of  calcium and magnesium. Rain water is soft, not containing any minerals, but as it seeps through the  ground  containing  chalk  or  limestone,  it  is  enriched  with  chemical  compounds.  These  are  the  compounds acting as buffers which avert any sudden changes of pH in a water body.  While playing a very important role in water bodies saving them from acidification, these same salts  cause unpleasant scale in boilers, pipes and kettles.

7) Task for making experimental procedure 
  In  order  to  see,  if  your  hypotheses  are  correct,  you  have  to  run  some  experiments.  In  your  experiments, you will examine  the  influence of different  types of ground on  pH of water.  Also you  will research which types of ground act as buffers and contribute to maintenance of a stable pH of  water even if an amount of acid is added.  Good  scientists  plan  their  experiments  in  advance,  in  order  to  have  a  clear  vision  what  is  going  to  happen and what kind of equipment and materials are needed. Please follow this good practice.   Now  your  task  is  to  compose  an  experimental  procedure.  An  experimental  procedure  is  a  stepby step  description  of  your  experiment,  containing  a  list  of  activities  that  have  to  be  done  and  the  materials which are to be used and in which quantities.  Please use COPEX tool in SCYLab to write your experimental procedure. This is a special tool which  will help you in succeeding in this task.

    9)  Task  for  conducting  the  experiment/game  either  in  real  or  with  simulation/SCYDynamics 
  Now it is time to conduct the experiment. Your task is to use mobile devices and run the experiments  to find out how different ground types influence the pH of water and, also, how acid rain can change  the pH of water. Please be careful working with sulphuric acid solutions. If you decide to change your  experimental procedure, make sure you write these changes down so that later you can refresh your  memory. 

10) Experimental procedure 
  1. Take a sample of a ground and wash it in tap water to remove dust and dirt.  2. Rinse sample with distilled water.   3. Weigh 5g of each ground to the vessels and add 50ml of distilled water to each of them.  4. Stir the mixtures about 1 minute.   5. Leave the samples on a table for 5 minutes before measuring pH.  6. Measure the pH of samples with Vernier pH sensor.  7. Add sulfuric acid to each sample (according to the table below) and stir the mixtures.   8. Measure the pH of samples with Vernier pH sensor.  Follow the same procedure according to the table.

Important notes: 
· · ·

Please test your Vernier pH sensor with standardized buffer solution before starting to  measure.  Please be patient, sometimes it takes some minutes until pH reading will stabilize.  Please gently stir Vernier pH sensor in distilled water and dry with a paper towel before each  measuring. 

11) Task for applying Data Processing tool in order to make inferences 
  Now you have to apply Data Processing tool and make inferences on the basis of the data you've  analyzed using this tool.    Inferences:   · pH of water with limestone ground is alkaline. pH of water with granite ground remains close  to neutral.  · Adding small amounts of sulphuric acid solution to water with limestone ground did not  affect pH of water. Adding same amount of sulphuric acid to water with granite ground  lowers pH.     

12) Task for formulating a solution for the topicspecific problem 
  Now your task is to formulate a problem solution.     Solution:   The reason, why acid rain causes a vast decline of pH value in water bodies of some countries while  having no similar effect in others, lies in different  composition  of ground. In countries with granite  bedrock,  acid  rain  causes  acidification  of  water  bodies.  In  other  countries  with  ground  containing  limestone, acid rain doesn't lower pH of water because of neutralizing effect of calcium carbonate in  limestone.
