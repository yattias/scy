A Fruitarian is one who eats mostly fruits, including some nuts, grains, and seeds. He does not eat meat. Not even vegetables, just fruits. The diet resembles that of a vegetarian, except that there cannot be vegetables present in the diet. You may find it strange, and wonder what harm is done by eating vegetables, but it does matter a little.

Why Fruits but No Vegetables?
A Fruitarian knows the cruelty of killing animals for food. He also feels that cruelty is done when we kill plants for vegetables. Usually the entire plant is harvested, as in the case of cabbages and lettuce, and then it is cooked and nutrients are lost. But eating fruits is natural. No plants die in the process. Fruits are actually meant to be eaten. The purpose of most fleshy fruits is to attract animals to eat them, and in the process help disperse the seeds of that plant. So by consuming fruits, we are actually doing the plants and trees a favor.
