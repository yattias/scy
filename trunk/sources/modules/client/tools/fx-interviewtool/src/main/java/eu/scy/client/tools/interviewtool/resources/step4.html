<i>Step 4: Formulate possible answer options</i><br>
Your __INDICATOR_NO__ indicator of __TOPIC__ is:<br>
__INDICATOR__
<p>
Create a list of all possible answers you might get to this question. Write them down below.
<p>
<b>Example</b><br>
If your indicator is “shower time”, possible answer options are:
<ul>
<li>1 minute
<li>2 minutes
<li>3 minutes
<li>4 minutes
<li>5 minutes
<li>More than 5 minutes
</ul>
Note that in theory the list of answer options is nearly endless. Narrowing it down to the most prevalent options is highly recommended. If you are unsure whether the resulting list is all-inclusive, you might include an “Other, namely…” option by ticking the corresponding box below.
