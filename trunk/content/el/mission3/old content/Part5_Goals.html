<p><strong>5.1 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>During the  previous activities you have learned about nutrients and their function in the  human body. As you remember, the overall goal of this mission is to create a  healthy pizza. But if you are eating your pizza, how do the nutrients enter  your bloodstream? In this activity you will learn about the different organs of  the digestive system and how they work.</p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to explain simple information to the rest of the class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to reproduce the basic anatomy of the digestive system.</li>
  <li>able  to explain the function of each organ of the digestive system, especially in  terms of (a) the secretion of digestive juices and (b) the absorption of  nutrients (including water).</li>
  <li>able  to explain that digestive juices contain certain substances (enzymes) that  break down nutrients into substances that are small enough to be absorbed by  the digestive system.</li>
</ul>
