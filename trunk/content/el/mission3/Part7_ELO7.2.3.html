<strong>7.2.3: Implementation of the optimization  strategy in the context of a healthy pizza.</strong><br />
In  order to apply the optimization strategy in the context of a healthy pizza, you  should follow a process similar to the one followed by Mr. Adam when purchasing  a car. Before you begin, however, first you need to recall all the ingredients  you selected during the first and second pizza simulation (part 1.1 and 7.1.1)  and create a table listing the nutrients (carbohydrates, fat, protein, etc.),  energy and cost of each of the pizza ingredient you chose.
