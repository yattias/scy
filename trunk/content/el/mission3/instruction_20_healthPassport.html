</p>
<p>You are now going to finish your health passport. Complete  the health passport with a short reflection (150 words maximum). Evaluate the balance  between daily calorie intake and estimated energy requirements. Also note if there are any signs of an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. a  BMI that is too high). Formulate a few recommendations for yourself  on  how to improve your dietary and exercising habits (when necessary).</p>
