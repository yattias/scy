<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />
  3.1: Food  pyramid information.<br />
  3.2: Food pyramid simulation.<br />
  3.3.1: The food diary of your character:  Calculate daily caloric intake. The students will <br />
  compare their personal food diary<strong> </strong>(activity 1.4.1) with the daily required quantity   <br />
  (activity 2.1.1) and the food  pyramid recommendations (activity 3.1) and derive  <br />
  conclusions on how healthy is their diet.  In addition, the students will use this <br />
  information to complete their personal  &lsquo;health passport&rsquo; (activity 6.3).<br />
  3.3.2: Evaluate  alter-ego/self diet in terms of the food pyramid. <br />
