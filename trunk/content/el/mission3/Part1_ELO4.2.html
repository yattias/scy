<p><strong>1.4.2: Create a food and exercise diary</strong> <br />
  The goal of  this mission is to create a healthy pizza. But in order to do that, you need to  know some things. For instance, you have to be able to calculate the amount of  nutrients and energy in a particular food item. You must also know how to  estimate the amount of energy your body uses while performing a particular  activity. You will practice all these skills during the mission. But if we want  to do calculations, we need numbers. And you will create these data yourself.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Pick one <strong>character</strong> from the list of characters [link to list with       descriptions]. This will be your alter-ego for the rest of the mission.</li>
  <li>Based on the description of       your character, you will create a detailed <strong>food and exercise diary</strong>. So, try to imagine what your       character would eat and drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner. What kind       of snacks would he or she consume (and how many)? And what kind of       activities will he or she perform throughout the day?</li>
  <li>Try to be as <strong>realistic</strong> as possible. You will       need these data throughout the mission for further calculations.</li>
  <li>Near the end of the mission       (during activity 6) you will compile a <strong>health passport</strong> [link to health passport] for the character       you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions for creating a food and exercise  diary</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>First check the example of a       food and exercise diary to get an impression how it should look.</li>
  <li>Write down everything your       character eats or drinks in a period of three days (from midnight to       midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down the name of       a particular food product, but also note the quantity he or she has       consumed (in grams or litres).</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about what       would be a realistic weight of a particular food item, you can:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>check  food packages at home or in a supermarket</li>
  <li>use  a (kitchen) scale or measuring cup to measure it</li>
  <li>find  the information you need on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start doing this, you will develop a  certain feeling about how much things weigh (e.g. an average sized glass is  about 200 ml).</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything your       character does in a period of three days (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down what he or       she is doing, but also how long he or she does it (in minutes).</li>
  <li>Even when your character is not       really exercising, but just attending class or sleeping (or both at the       same time), his or her body consumes energy. So, you also have to note       these kinds of activities.</li>
  <li>If your character is performing       the same activity twice during one hour (e.g. walking to the video store,       and 20 minutes later walking back to your house) you can of course add       these two values up.</li>
