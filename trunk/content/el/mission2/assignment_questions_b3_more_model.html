<h3>Formulating research questions (SCY Dynamics model)</h3>
<p>By now you have to be able to handle the most important concepts necessary to describe relationships between trophic levels, aquatic ecosystems, and prey-predator interactions. The next step of our investigation involves experimentation with a prey-predator model. This model will simulate the interaction between the prey and the predator populations. You can find this model in SCY-Lab. First, you have to read the description of the SCY Dynamics model (see next section). Afterwards, you have to formulate your main research questions. The research questions will have to be related to the result of the model simulation and should describe what you want to find out through the simulation. Note that each research question you formulate should contain only variables, which you are able to measure by collecting data by the simulation of the prey-predator relationship. Most frequently, research questions attempt to address a possible relation between two variables (e.g., 'What is the relation between variable 1 and variable 2?‘). You can start by defining the variables that can be measured by the simulation.</p>
