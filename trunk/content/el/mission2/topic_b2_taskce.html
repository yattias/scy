<h1>Conducting the experiment in real</h1>
<p>Plan how you will record the data from your experiment. You can use both a table and a graph to illustrate your results. There are also some tips for conducting this experiment:</p>
<ul><li>Don’t use common energy saver bulbs for this experiment!</li></ul>
<ul><li>The light spectrum of energy savers is not appropriate for photosynthesis.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pull the curtains and trim the lights in your room to minimize the experiment constraining light.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Let the water from the tap to flow in to the beaker with steady small stream without getting air bubbles.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The water should be at room temperature (18-23 <sup>o</sup>C).</li></ul>
<p>Now it’s your time to start with experimenting. <a href="topic_b2_taskexp.html">Experimental procedure</a> developed by experts could help you at this stage.</p>
