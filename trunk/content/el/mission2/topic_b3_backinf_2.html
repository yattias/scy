<h1 class="mainTitle">Food chains and food webs</h1>
<p>Since organisms are dependent upon other organisms for their food, we can construct ‘food chains’ by following the feeding habits of various organisms. Each food chain has at its starting point a plant species. However, most species do not feed on a specific feeding source but present feeding behaviour which includes a range of feeding sources. Further, feeding sources might vary according to the season. In order to describe this variety, scientists use the term ‘food web’, which comprise ensembles of interconnected food chains.</p>
