<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Before you actually start performing your experiments, you have to describe what you plan to do. In other words, you have to write an experimental procedure. An experimental procedure is a detailed, step-by-step description of an experiment. Even when you plan to execute the experiment yourself, your experimental procedure has to be precise and clear. Another person should have enough information to perform the experiment in the same way. An experimental procedure is usually composed of a list of tasks that have to be carried out. All instructions must specify the materials that should be used, and the parameters that define the task (e.g. the quantities of substances, the input parameters of a device, etc.). An example of a certain task could be: &quot;measure 50 ml of solution S with a 50 ml pipette&quot;.</p>
<p>In SCYLab, there is a tool that is specifically designed for describing your experimental procedures. Use this tool to carry out your task. Since you are not going to perform any real experiments, the instructions in your experimental procedure do not mention any materials. However, you still have to provide details on the steps that you will undertake. An example of such a step could be: &quot;run the model with five different values for nitrate (10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 μmol/l) and a fixed value of phosphate (10 μmol/l), and save the datasets&quot;.</p>
<h3>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</h3>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process. First open your hypotheses and copy the content to the hypotheses field of your experimetal procedure. You can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a> for planning experiments.</p>
