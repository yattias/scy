<h1 class="mainTitle">The impact of prey-predator relationship on the characteristic features of species</h1>
<p>The interactions between species have a significant impact on the characteristic features of species. Focusing on prey-predator relationships, traits that are crucial in determining a predator’s ability to capture individuals of the prey population will tend to increase their frequency in the predator population, namely, more individuals are expected to carry those traits in future generations. Accordingly, traits that reinforce the prey’s ability to avoid its predator will tend to increase in frequency in the forthcoming generations. Since the traits selected for each partner of the relationship are not compatible, the prey-predator relationship is continuously evolving. Quite interestingly, the behaviour of the predator determines to a large extent the features of the prey and vice versa.</p>
