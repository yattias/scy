<h1>Applying Data Processing tool in order to make inferences</h1>
<p>You have already conducted a set of experiments and recorded pH values in case of different types of ground. Now you have to apply Data Processing tool and construct a graph depicting changes of pH in water with different types of ground depending on different concentrations of sulphuric acid added. Plot the amounts of sulphuric acid on the X-axis. Plot pH on the Y-axis. Set maximum and minimum value of pH on the basis of the results of your experiments. When completed the graph, you should make inferences on the basis of the data youâ€™ve analyzed using this tool.</p>
