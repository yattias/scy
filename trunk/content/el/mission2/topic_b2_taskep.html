<h1>Making experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Plan an experiment where you study the effect of the light intensity on the oxygen concentration in water produced by plant. You have to use a light sensor and an oxygen probe to measure light intensity and concentration of oxygen in water.</p>
<h3>Some tips!</h3>
<p>Plan how you will record the data from your experiment. You can use both a table and a graph to illustrate your results. There are also some tips for conducting this experiment:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don’t use common energy saver bulbs for this experiment!</li>
	<li>The light spectrum of energy savers is not appropriate for photosynthesis.</li>
	<li>Pull the curtains and trim the lights in your room to minimize the experiment constraining light.</li>
	<li>Let the water from the tap to flow in to the beaker with steady small stream without getting air bubbles.</li>
	<li>The water should be at room temperature (18-23 °C).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</h3>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process. First open your hypotheses and copy the content to the hypotheses field of your experimetal procedure. If your previously formulated research questions and hypotheses are not discoverable with the tools and equipment available, please revise these and write your updated research questions and hypotheses to the Experimental procedure ELO. Here you may also search for the ELOs of your buddies in order to develop your own Experimental procedure. You can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a> for planning experiments.</p>
