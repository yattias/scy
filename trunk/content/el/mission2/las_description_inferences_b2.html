<p>In order to test if your previously stated hypotheses are correct, you have to run some experiments. 
Here you can compose the following assignments:</p>
<p>1. Experimental procedure. First you have to plan your experiment. For that, open the &quot;Experimental procedure&quot; ELO and follow all the instructions given in the drawers.</p> 
<p>2. Data collection. After your experimental procedure is finished, you will conduct the experiment outside the SCY-Lab and collect the data.</p> 
<p>3. Data analysis. Open Data processing tool and analyze the data collected from your experiments.</p>
<p>4. Formulating inferences. Open the &quot;Inference&quot; ELO and make your inferences.</p>
<table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>After formulating your inferences, open the mission map and move next to the <b>Problem solution</b> space.</td>

	<b>Learning goals</b><br />
	After successfully completing the assignments, you are able to act as a researcher and:
	<ul>
	  <li>plan experiments for testing your hypotheses;</li>
	  <li>carry out real experiments by using mobile measurement devices;</li>
	  <li>analyse, visualise and interpret data gathered from your experiments;</li>
	  <li>relate your research findings with the hypotheses and formulate inferences;</li>
	  <li>effectively collaborate with peers.</li>
    </ul>
