<h1 class="mainTitle">Phytoplankton and primary production</h1>
<p>In ecosystems, a distinction is made between producers, consumers and reducers. All organisms that harvest energy from the sun and are able to build their own organic molecules, such as glucose, are called producers. All plants are producers. Consumers (such as animals)  get their energy from eating other organisms. In aquatic ecosystems, a further distinction can be made between macrophytes (larger water plants) and phytoplankton. The term plankton refers to small drifting organisms. Some species of plankton are producers (<strong>phytoplankton</strong>, such as algae), other species are consumers (zooplankton, such as <i>Daphnia</i>). In many aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton are the main producers.</p>
<p><strong>Primary production</strong> is the process by which producers (plants) build new organic molecules from inorganic substances. Primary production usually involves <strong>photosynthesis</strong> and an increase in the amount of organic molecules. Therefore, the total weight of the producers themselves is a good measure of the rate of primary production in an ecosystem. The term biomass is often used for this purpose. Biomass is defined as the total mass of living organisms in a specific ecosystem at a specific time. Biomass may be measured as the total, natural weight of the organisms themselves or as the dry organic weight (when all water has been extracted). In the context of our mission we will focus on the weight of the producers only.</p>
