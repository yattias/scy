<h1>Experimental procedure
</h1>
<p>The next step in the mission is to design the experiment. You will do this collaboratively in a group of students. You have 4 lipstick samples that need to be tested: one lipstick sample on a glove from the main suspect’s house and three lipstick tubes belonging to the victim. You have to investigate if there is a match between the lipstick on the glove and the three other ones.</p>
<p>Make sure you work extremely precisely and record exactly what you are going to do. Sloppy work may result in the crime not being solved! You have to take the following steps:
</p>
<p>1.	Write a hypothesis by finishing the following sentence: “If the dies of a lipstick ... , then ...”
<br />
2.	Describe what materials you are going to use during the experiment.<br />
3.	Describe the experiment step by step. Don't forget to specify the quantities you will use.
</p>
<p>Experiments should be optimized with the best experimental conditions for your current analysis. Therefore, compare your results with the other groups.</p>
