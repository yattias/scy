<p><strong>MENFORD</strong> - Peter P. who assaulted his wife last week, is also charged with the Menford crime.</p>
<p>During P's arrest, the police discovered that he was heard before, namely during the Menford crime in 1999. The police opened this case again and discovered that P. lived originally in Menford only a few hundred meters away from the crime scene. </p>

<p>During further research a DNA match between Peter P. and the most important evidence, desquamated skin under the woman's nails, was found. P. remains under arrest while new pieces of evidence are researched by forensic experts. </p>
