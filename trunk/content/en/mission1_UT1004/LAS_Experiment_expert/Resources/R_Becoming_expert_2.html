<h2>How? What? Where?
</h2>
<p>Following these steps, you will build up a lot of knowledge on certain aspects of CO2-friendly building. Later on, each of you will be using this knowledge for the benefit of your own design. But for now you have to operate as a team. </p>
<h2>What must be delivered?
</h2>
<p>Scientists often share the outcome of their research in a written report. Instead of writing a report, you will present your findings in a concept-map. This concept-map explains the relations between the concepts and variables you have explored.<br />
</p>
<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<p>But first you have to become an expert. It is often a good idea to start with doing some background reading and study existing resources on your topic(s). After you have become acquainted with the most important terms and concepts in your field of knowledge, it is time to formulate a couple of research questions. If your question can be answered experimentally, the next sequence of steps will guide you through the process of designing and running experiments, and drawing conclusions from them. When needed, ask your teacher for feedback.</p>
