<h2>What will make your house CO2-friendly?
</h2>
<p>Your goal is to design a CO2-friendly house. The past few lessons you have been working to gain a lot of knowledge about all kinds of measurements that might influence the CO2-friendliness of a house. Each of you has been working in a particular field of knowledge: thermal insulation, energy production, or domestic issues. Now the time has come to start designing (i.e., drawing, describing, simulating) YOUR OWN HOUSE.</p>
<p>To help you get started, your group will make an <span class="Bold">inventory</span> of all the possible CO2-friendly solutions and adaptations that each group member knows of. Like in the brainstorm session at the beginning of the mission, you will use the schematic drawing of a house to make this inventory. Arrange all ideas around (and in) the drawing.</p>
