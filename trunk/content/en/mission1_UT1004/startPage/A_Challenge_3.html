<h1>How to tackle the assignment?
</h1>
You will be working on a number of tasks.
<h3>1. Orientation on CO2 friendly constructions
</h3>
It is important that the latest insights on CO2-friendly constructions are implemented in your design. Therefore you should make an extensive study of existing examples of CO2-friendly houses. The commissioning company wants a list of factors which contribute to the CO2 emission of houses.
<h3>2. Expert analysis concerning energy, insulation, construction, domestic use
</h3>
Divide your team so that each team member has to investigate and specialize in one of the three following aspects: you are either a thermal expert, an energy expert or a domestic expert.
Then, make a table in which you describe all materials, systems, applications and models with energy emission results needed to create your own CO2 friendly house. What are the specifics of each application/measure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each application?
<p>The commissioning company wants you to keep in mind the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Suitability</b> - can it be applied in the house?</li>
<li><b>Capital investment recovery time</b> - what are the costs and how long does it take for these to be earned back?</li>
<li><b>Size</b> - is it suitable to fit  into the house?</li>
<li><b>Noise</b> - is it quiet enough to implement in a house?</li>
<li><b>Combination/flexibility</b> - is it  possibility to combine different measures in an practical way?</li>
<li><b>Reliability</b> - has it been tested enough or are there still (technical) teething problems?</li>
<li><b>Image and appearance</b> - are the measures attractive? </li>
</ul>
<h3>3. List of demands and schematic drawings
</h3>
Make a list of demands your CO2-friendly house has to comply with. Make schematic drawings of the house with detailed  drawings of the different measures to be taken. The commissioning company wants to get a clear impression of your ideas based on these drawings.
<h3>4. Simulation and testing of the house 
</h3>
Make a simulation of your design by using the simulation program. Write a test report and test the effect of your plans. Ask yourself if your house is as CO2 friendly as possible. If not search for improvements in the measures, materials or models and re-start the simulation until you are satisfied. Use the data to finalize your test report.
<h3>5. Consulting report 
</h3>
Write a report advising the commissioning company in which your analyses, solutions, design and test results are included.
