<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />
  7.1. Create a pizza.<br />
  7.1.1. Presentation of the methodology and criteria used in  the creation of the pizza.<br />
  7.2: Optimization strategy.<br />
  7.2.1: Importance of criteria.<br />
  7.2.2: Evaluation of the optimization strategy.<br />
  7.2.3: Implementation of the optimization strategy in the  context of a healthy pizza.<br />
  7.2.3.1: Pizza optimization strategy: step one.<br />
  7.2.3.2: Pizza optimization strategy: step two.<br />
  <strong>________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of Activity 7: </strong>In this  activity you will create a second pizza and discus the steps you followed in  doing so. Then you will be introduced to the optimization strategy using a  simple application example. Following the example, you will have a chance to  apply the optimization strategy using the pizza ingredients. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>identify a problem and formulate hypotheses.</li>
  <li>design, plan and perform experiments to test the  hypotheses.</li>
  <li>organize, analyze and interpret data.</li>
  <li>collaborate with peers (share tasks/information,  collaborate on experiments, make decision together, etc.).</li>
  <li>reflect on your own knowledge and learning goals.</li>
  <li>present in the presence of a large group  (partners and/or classmates).</li>
  <li>write individual reports and assignments.</li>
  <li>perform simple calculations (e.g. additions and  multiplications).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain-specific  learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>created a healthy pizza based on the information  attained from the previous activities.</li>
  <li>present the methodology you followed in order to  create a healthy pizza.</li>
  <li>study an example of the optimization strategy.</li>
  <li>investigate the information (nutrients, energy,  cost) for the ingredients you selected in Activity 2, through a market research  or through a web-search.</li>
  <li>present the criteria you used in order to select  the ingredients for your pizza.Â  </li>
  <li>implement the optimization strategy in order to  create a healthy pizza. </li>
  <li>evaluate the optimization strategy. </li>
  <li>answer questions concerning the importance of the  criteria and explain your reasoning.</li>
  <li>explain how the optimization strategy can be  used to numerically weigh criteria.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
