<p><strong>05: Nutrients table</strong><br />
  </p>
<p>During the previous activity, you have created a personal food and exercise diary. 
What exactly is in all these food products that you have consumed? Everything you eat or drink contains different (combinations of) nutrients. 
In this activity you will learn about these nutrients and their function in the human body. 
Visit the internet pages in the resource drawer and complete the table:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Under 'Nutrients' list  the six nutrient categories (A-F).</li>
<li>Fill in their three main functions (G-I) under 'Function'.</li>
<li>Indicate the function of  each nutrient (enter a 'x' in the appropriate cells).</li>
<li>List three types of foods for each nutrient category and - if possible - provide their daily required quantity.</p></li>
</ul><p>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please proceed with the "Nutrient and Energy Calculations" activity.</p>
