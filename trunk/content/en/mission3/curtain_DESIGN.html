several virtual pizza's. First you will create your own favourite pizza. Use the pizza simulation to create your own 'slice of heaven' by 
selecting your favorite crust, sauce, cheese(s), vegetables and meats for your pizza. Since you are the cook you can be as creative as you like. 
Later on in the mission you will be asked to create several other pizzas, using everything you will have learned by then.
