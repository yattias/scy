<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />
  8.1:  Creation of a healthy pizza.<br />
  8.2:  Compare pizzas.<br />
  8.2.1:  Compare pizzas among groups.<br />
  8.2.2:  Optional: pizza taste competition.<br />
  8.3:  Reflection.<br />
  <strong>________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of Activity 8: </strong>Based on the  optimization strategy, you will create a new healthy pizza and calculate its  nutritional value. You will then compare all three pizzas you created  throughout the mission. Finally, you will have the opportunity to compare and  compete for the healthiest pizza among your peers. </p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>identify a problem and formulate hypotheses.</li>
  <li>organize, analyze and interpret data.</li>
  <li>collaborate with peers (share tasks/information,  collaborate on experiments, make decision together, etc.).</li>
  <li>reflect on your own knowledge and learning goals.</li>
  <li>present in the presence of a large group  (partners and/or classmates).</li>
  <li>write individual reports and assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain-specific  learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>create your final healthy pizza using the  optimization strategy.</li>
  <li>compare the pizzas you created throughout the  mission and decide which is the healthiest.</li>
  <li>compare your pizzas with those of other groups  and compete for the healthiest and tastiest one.</li>
  <li>respond to questions concerning the epistemological  issues of the optimization strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.1: Creation of a healthy pizza.</strong><br />
  Based on what you have studied so far and  implementing the optimization strategy, create your third healthy pizza, using  the same simulation tool. This time however, the simulation tool will carry out  all the calculations for you, based on the weight value you assigned in the  previous activity. Finally, you will have to calculate the nutrients and energy  of your pizza and create a nutritional value label per serving (slice or  /100g).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>8.2: Compare pizzas you created.</strong><br />
  Describe the strategy you  followed to create each pizza. Which one of the three pizzas you created is  healthier and why?</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>8.2.1: Compare pizzas among groups.</strong><br />
Compare your pizza with  those of your peers and rank them based on healthiness and cost. Explain your  reasoning and present your results to the rest of the class.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>8.2.2: Pizza taste competition (optional)</strong><br />
  If the participating  schools have the suitable equipment and the appropriate building installations,  students can attempt to bake a real pizza, using the ingredients they have  selected. In addition, they can have a competition for the tastiest pizza in  their class or school. If no equipment and/or facilities are available, the  schools could try to contract a local restaurant to bake the students’ pizzas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.3: Reflection</strong><br />
  Now that you are aware of  the benefits of a healthy diet and the hidden dangers consuming food products  high in fat, sugar and salt content, you should choose the healthier pizza you  have created in order to present it to your school’s canteen/cafeteria. As a  member of the student health committee at your school, write a letter to your school canteen/cafeteria (or school  principle) presenting your pizza. Explain why your pizza provides a  healthier option from what is sold/served  right now at your school.</p>
