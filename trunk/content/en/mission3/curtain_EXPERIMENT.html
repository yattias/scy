<p><strong>Health Passport:</strong>  You probably think you have a reasonable idea of what you eat and drink on an average day. 
But do you know how many grams of food you actually consume? How about the amount of fluids you drink? 
Finally, how much do you exercise? Well, now is the time to find out. For the duration of one day, you are going to keep track 
of everything you eat and drink as well as your daily activity. You are going to record this information in a food and exercise diary.
Later on you will use these data to compile your own Health Passport.
