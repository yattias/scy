<p><strong>10: Calculate daily calorie intake </strong><br />
</p>
<p>How many calories do you take in during an average day? 
You will find out during this activity. 
Use the food and exercise diary you created before to create a table like 
<a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_10_table.html" target ="_moreResources">this example</a>.

<p>1. Open your food and exercise diary.</p>
<p>2. Make an inventory  of all food and drink items you have consumed for all three days combined (column 1). </p>
<p>3. For each item, note the total amount consumed (column 2).</p>
<p>4. For each item, find the amount of  calories per 100 g for each item on this website: www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search (column 3).</p>
<p>5. For each item, calculate the amount of calories consumed (column 4). You can do this by multiplying column 2 and 3.</p>
<p>6. Calculate the total amount of calories you consumed over three days. Then divide the  resulting value by three in order to find the average daily amount of calories. This value (daily calorie intake) will be used for your Health Passport.</p>
