<p><strong>04: </strong><strong>Your personal food and exercise diary</strong><br />
  </p>
<p>You probably think you have a reasonable idea of what you eat and drink on an average day. 
But do you know how many grams of food you actually consume?  
Or how many litres of fluids you drink? Finally, how much do you exercise? 
Now  is the time to find out. For the duration of three days, you are going to keep track of everything you eat and drink. 
You are going to put this information in a food and exercise diary.</p>


<p>Read the <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_04_foodAndExerciseDiary_popup.html" target ="_moreResources">instructions</a> to see how to note down the information.</p>

<p>Also check the <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_04_foodAndExerciseDiary_extra.html" target ="_moreResources">example of a food and exercise diary</a> to get you started. Please note that the information you put in your diary is  private. You do not have to share it with others.</p>
</br><p>What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Nutrients and Energy Calculations" and the "Nutrition Table" activity.</p>
