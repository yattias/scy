<p><strong>19: Heart rate</strong> <br />
  </p>
<p>You have  seen the physicians that were monitoring Morgan&rsquo;s health in &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;  measuring his heart rate and blood pressure. These values might provide  information about a person&rsquo;s health. Even though we are not physicians, and  therefore cannot make a reliable medical interpretation, it might be  interesting to measure our heart rate as well.</p>
<p>Heart rate  is measured in beats per minute (bpm). You probably know that your heart beats  a lot faster when you are exercising. For the health passport we need the <em>resting heart rate</em>. This is the heart  rate when a person is awake, but not doing any physical work. A healthy resting  heart rate will be somewhere in between 60 and 80 bpm for adults. For  teenagers, the outer limits of this healthy range are set even further apart.  Resting heart rates of 90 bpm are no exception. But heart rates below 60 bpm  are also common, especially if you exercise regularly.</p>
<p><em>Measuring your own heart rate</em><br />
There are a  number of places on your body where you can feel your own pulse. A good place  to start looking for it would be your neck, where you probably will be able to  find the pulse of the so called carotid artery just below your chin (see the  drawing below).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sit  down and relax your muscles. Place two fingers of one hand just below your chin  and try to find your pulse. Hold a stopwatch in your other hand. Once you have  found your pulse, start the stopwatch and count the number of heartbeats for  one minute.</li>
  <li>Ask  two of your fellow students to measure your heart rate as well.</li>
  <li>Calculate  the average of these three measurements. This value will be a reasonably good  estimate of your heart rate.</li>
  <li>This value will be used for your Health Passport.</li>
</ul>

What to do next: After you complete this activity, please proceed with the "Health Passport" activity.</p>
