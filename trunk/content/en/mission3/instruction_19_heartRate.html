<p><strong>19: Heart rate</strong> <br />
  </p>
<p><em>Measuring your own <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_19_heartRate_popup.html" target ="_moreResources">heart rate</a>.</em><br />
</br>There are a  number of places on your body where you can feel your own pulse. A good place  to start looking for it would be your neck, where you probably will be able to  find the pulse of the so called carotid artery just below your chin (see the  drawing below).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sit  down and relax your muscles. Place two fingers of one hand just below your chin  and try to find your pulse. Hold a stopwatch in your other hand. Once you have  found your pulse, start the stopwatch and count the number of heartbeats for  one minute.</li>
  <li>Ask  two of your fellow students to measure your heart rate as well.</li>
  <li>Calculate  the average of these three measurements. This value will be a reasonably good  estimate of your heart rate.</li>
  <li>This value will be used for your Health Passport.</li>
</ul>
<p></br>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please proceed with the "Health Passport" activity.</p>
