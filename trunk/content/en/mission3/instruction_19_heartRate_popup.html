<p><strong>Heart rate</strong> <br />
  </p>
<p>You have  seen the physicians that were monitoring Morgan&rsquo;s health in &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;  measuring his heart rate and blood pressure. These values might provide  information about a person&rsquo;s health. Even though we are not physicians, and  therefore cannot make a reliable medical interpretation, it might be  interesting to measure our heart rate as well.</p>
<p>Heart rate  is measured in beats per minute (bpm). You probably know that your heart beats  a lot faster when you are exercising. For the health passport we need the <em>resting heart rate</em>. This is the heart  rate when a person is awake, but not doing any physical work. A healthy resting  heart rate will be somewhere in between 60 and 80 bpm for adults. For  teenagers, the outer limits of this healthy range are set even further apart.  Resting heart rates of 90 bpm are no exception. But heart rates below 60 bpm  are also common, especially if you exercise regularly.</p>
