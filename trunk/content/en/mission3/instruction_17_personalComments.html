<p><strong>17: Food and health problems </strong></p>
<p>Your teacher will show you parts of a documentary called &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;. 
In this documentary, we follow Morgan Spurlock from New York, who engages in  a bizarre experiment: 
he will eat only fast food (at McDonalds) three meals a  day, for thirty days in a row. 
A number of physicians monitor his physical and  mental health during this experiment. 
After watching the documentary there will  be a classroom discussion. 
Finally, you will have to write short comments on a set of statements related to this topic.</p>
<p>1. Watch the documentary &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo; (shown by your teacher).</p>
<p>2. There  will be a classroom discussion on some of the issues brought forward by the documentary. 
In preparation for the discussion, write short comments on paper (50 words  maximum) to each of the five statements.</p>
<p>3. Participate  in the classroom discussion led by your teacher.</p>
<p>4. After the classroom discussion, write down your final comments in the text.</p>
<p></br>
