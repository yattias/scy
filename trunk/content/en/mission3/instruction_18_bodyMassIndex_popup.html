<p><strong>Body mass index</strong></p>
<p> The Health  Passport you have already been working on brings together the most important facts regarding your diet (and  health). 
During previous activities you have already calculated the daily calorie intake, BMR and EER. 
Now you will calculate your body mass index (BMI). The Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to indicate whether someone has a healthy body weight.  
You probably remember the dietician measuring Morgan&rsquo;s bodyweight in &lsquo;Super  Size Me&rsquo;. 
To calculate the BMI, you need to know the weight (in kilograms) and  the height (in metres) of a person.</p>

<p>What does a particular BMI value say about physical health? There are roughly four different categories:</p>
<p>Underweight                 your BMI is under 18.5<br />
  Normal weight              your BMI is in  between 18.5 and 25<br />
  Overweight                   your BMI is in between 25 and 30<br />
  Obese                           your  BMI is over 30</p>
<p>But  before jumping to conclusions, you should be aware that these categories  normally apply to adults. Your own body is still developing and growing, and your  BMI might change considerably over the years.</p>
