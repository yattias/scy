<p>You may have prepared (and realized) some real experiments but those of you who belong to the <span class="Bold">Domestic use expert group</span> may also carry out some virtual experiments using the <span class="Bold">Energy consumption simulation</span> (<a href="http://bio.edu.ee/flash/electricity/" class="external" target="_external">http://bio.edu.ee/flash/electricity/</a>)</p>
<p>You can read the manual to understand what you can do with this simulation (manual incorporated in the tool). At the end of your experiment, save your data set and it will appear on your SCY-Lab screen. If your experiments produce large sets of numerical data, it is often a good idea to reorganize them in a structured and convenient way. You want to present your data in such a way, that it is easy to understand what measurements you have made and what the outcome of your experiments is.</p>
<p>General guidelines for processing data are:
<ul>
<li>calculate mean values (and maybe standard deviations)</li>
<li>present the most relevant data in small tables</li>
<li>plot data for independent and dependent variables in diagrams</li>
<li>use a simple statistical test to assess the validity of your conclusions</li>
</ul>
