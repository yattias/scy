<p>Here are some guidelines for preparing your presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation itself should take no longer than 10  minutes.</li>
<li>The presentation may be done by your whole design  group, or by one or two representatives (consult your teacher).</li>
<li>If you choose to hold the presentation with two or  more people, make sure that each speaker has a specific part of the  presentation for which he or she is responsible.</li>
<li>When you are finished with the preparatory work, ask  your teacher for some final feedback.</li>
<li>Practice your  presentation a few times in your design group.</li>
</ul>
