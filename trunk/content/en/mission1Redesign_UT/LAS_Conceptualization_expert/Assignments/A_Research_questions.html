<p>Now that you are more or less familiar with the most important concepts and factors in your expert domain, it is time to formulate one or more research questions. A research question precisely describes something that you want to find out. But what is a ‘good’ research question? Formulating research questions can be quite difficult if you have never done it before. Here are some guidelines that will help you:</p>
<p>- Choose a question that is not too broad and not too narrow.<br />
- A question has to be researchable (e.g. you have to be able to collect the right data).<br />
- ‘Open’ questions (questions starting with words like ‘What’, ‘How’ or ‘When’) are usually more useful than ‘closed’ questions (questions to which the answer is either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’).<br />
- A useful phrase could be: ‘what is the influence of [concept 1] on [concept 2]?’</p>
<p>Start your expert research by formulating three research questions (for the whole group). Additional questions can be added later on.
