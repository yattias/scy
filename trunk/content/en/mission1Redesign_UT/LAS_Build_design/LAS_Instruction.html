<h1>Design your own CO2-friendly house
</h1>
<p>After each member of your group has become an expert in a particular field of knowledge, It is now time to actually start designing your own CO-2-friendly house. Each member of your design group has become an expert in a particular field of knowledge. You have shared these differents kinds of expertise and made decisions on the basis of this shared knowledge for the design of your CO-2 friendly house. So all preparations have been done, and the 'real' design work can begin! </p>
<p>In this activity you will design your CO-2 friendly house using either a technical drawing software program or paper and pencil. Make sure that your design is consistent with the choices you have made before! At the end of the mission you have to present your house design to your client: the mayor of your city. </p>
<p>Please remember, the reduction of CO2-emissions is the central issue. But at the same time, your house has to provide room and a reasonable level of comfort for a family of four members (two parents and two children).</p>
