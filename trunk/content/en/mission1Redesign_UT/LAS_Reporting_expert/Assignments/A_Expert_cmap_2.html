<h2>How to start?
</h2>
<p>1. Start by putting a small number of concepts that are important for your expert domain in the concept-map.<br />
2. Then, try to connect those concepts with each other. An arrow connecting two concepts should also have a label: a word or a brief phrase that defines the relationship between these concepts (e.g. ‘released by’ or ‘produces’).<br />
3. Each concept or idea has to be connected with, at least, one other concept.<br />
4. From that point on, your concept map will grow. You will probably think of new concepts that are related to the ones that are already in the concept map.<br />
5. Of course you can always make changes to parts of your concept map you have done earlier.</p>
