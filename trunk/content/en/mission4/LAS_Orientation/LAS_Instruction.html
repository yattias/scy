<h1>Orientation
</h1>
<p>A number of samples are sent to your laboratory by the attorney general. These six samples are all related to the same murder case (case number CY0347), and include one <span class="Bold">evidence sample</span> and five <span class="Bold">reference samples</span>, namely:</p>
<li>a sample collected at the crime scene itself (blood trace)</li>
<li>a sample taken from the victim</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect A</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect B</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect C</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect D</li>
<p>The assignment of the attorney general is the following:</p>
<p>“Possible cell material should be taken from the crime scene sample in order to produce a DNA-profile, after which the obtained DNA-profile should be compared with the profile of the arrested, or yet to be arrested, suspects and third-party (victim) in this investigation. In case no match is found, the crime scene profile should be saved in the DNA database and compared to other profiles in the database.”</p>
