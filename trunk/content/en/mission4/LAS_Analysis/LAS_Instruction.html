<h1>Analysis
</h1>
<p>In this part of the mission you will draw a conclusion from the results of your experiment. In particular you will try to establish who was the donor of the blood trace found at the crime scene. In addition, you will make an attempt to calculate the probability that a match between the evidence sample (the blood trace) and a reference sample (of one of the suspects) would occur by chance.</p>

<p>When you are an expert in chemical analysis, you will organize your data in a table. Then you will draw a conclusion from the results of your experiments. In particular you will try to establish if the lipstick traces found at the main suspect’s house matches one of the victim’s lipsticks.</p>
