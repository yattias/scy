<p>In this part of the mission you will draw a conclusion from the results of your experiment. Don't forget to compare your results with the results from your peers. In particular you will try to establish who was the donor of the blood trace found at the crime scene. In addition, you will make an attempt to calculate the probability that a match between the evidence sample (the blood trace) and a reference sample (of one of the suspects) would occur by chance.</p>
