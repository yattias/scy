<h1>Probabilities
</h1>
<p>This assignment is optional. Your teacher will tell you whether you have to do this activity or not.<br />
<br />
The last decade there have been major developments in the field of genomics and biotechnology, some of which had profound impact on forensic research. Nowadays, the technique of using restriction enzymes to create band patterns on a gel is already a bit old-fashioned. Modern DNA-profiles look quite different. They show a pattern of peaks in a diagram, each peak representing an allele (on a specific locus in the DNA). A major advantage of this new technique (capillary electrophoresis) is that is has more discriminating power. Nevertheless, the chances of two unrelated individuals having the same DNA-profile are not zero. It is your job to calculate the <span class="Bold">profile frequency</span>. The profile frequency is sometimes referred to as the <span class="Bold">random match probability</span>: the probability that the match between two samples is a result of chance.<br />
<br />
1. Consult the <span class="external">handbook</span> [hyperlink] to familiarize yourself with the following concepts: allele frequency, heterozygous, homozygous, hypervariable regions, locus, product rule and STRs (Short Tandem Repeats).<br />
2. Calculate the frequency of the DNA-profile of the suspect that matched the evidence sample. For this task you need two datasets:
<li>the <span class="external">DNA-profiles</span> with the STR alleles of your samples [hyperlink]</li>
<li>a table with the <span class="external">allele frequencies</span> in the entire human population [hyperlink]</li>
