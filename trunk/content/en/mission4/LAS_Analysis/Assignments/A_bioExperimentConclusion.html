<h1>Conclusion of the experiment
</h1>
<p>
In order to ensure the reliability of results, experiments should always be performed more than once. Instead of that, compare your results with others. For this, use the <span class="Bold">search tool</span> (on the bottom left corner of the screen) to retreive the "Results of the experiments" from your colleagues.<br />
<br />
Based on your results and others, make your conclusion. Explain how and why you can make this conclusion.<br />
<br />
When you have finished, ask your colleagues for <span class="Bold">feedback</span>. To do that, open the "F" drawer.</p>
