<p>The police was asked by the Attorney general to find more evidence to link the new suspect to the murder. While the police was looking for more evidence, they received an anonymous letter. The written text was the following: “I confirm that Mr X murdered the 25 year old girl in the wood, I saw him in 1999”. The police would like to find this mysterious informer, to interrogate him and have him testify at the court.
The police made the hypothesis that if a person saw the crime, he/she might have lived in 1999 next to the wood where the action happened. They started to search for houses around the wood where people have been living for the past ten years. They got a warrant to look for inks in these houses to compare with the ink of the anonymous letter.

You are an expert in chemical analysis. Your job is to analyse samples that are sent to your lab. This can only be done successfully if you master your domain of expertise.<br />
<br />
In order to help you organize your knowledge, you will make a concept map including the concepts related to the techniques that you know and that can be used in chemical analysis. As you will use Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) in this mission, chromatography will be a central concept of the map.</p>
