<p>You are an expert on DNA. Your job is to isolate DNA from the biological samples that are sent to your lab. The quality of these samples partly depends on how they are collected by your colleagues at the crime scene itself, the crime scene examiners.<br />
<br />
In this first part of the mission you will write a checklist for crime scene examiners on how to collect, store and transport samples.</p>
