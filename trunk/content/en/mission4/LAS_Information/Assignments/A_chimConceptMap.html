<h1>Concept Map for chemical analysis
</h1>
<p>Since you are a new chemical expert in the forensic SCY-Lab, your colleagues need to know if you understand your domain of expertise and the technique you are going to use: the thin layer chromatography (TLC).
<br />Firts read the handbook section about chemistry. Then, make a concept map related to the domain and the techniques of chemical analysis.<br />
<br />
There is a double goal in this activity:
<ul><li>Identify and organize the concepts related to the TLC</li>
<li>Connect the TLC to the other techniques that a chemical analyst might use.</li></ul>
Parts of the concept map are already given. Use given concepts and linking words to complete your concept map.
