<p>In this part of the mission you are going to design the experimental procedure according to the techniques you have selected. You are going to define each step in the experimental process as precisely as possible, e.g. what are the techniques that you are going to employ, what materials do you need, and in what amounts, etcetera. Think carefully, because in the next part of the mission you will actually perform the experiment that you have designed.
