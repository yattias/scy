<h1>Experimental procedure
</h1>
<p>The next step in the mission is to design the experiment. To do this work, you can join a couple of classmates and collaborate. As you know you have six DNA samples that need to be tested: one DNA sample from the crime scene and five reference samples to investigate if there is a match with the DNA from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Make sure you work extremely precise and record exactly what you are going to do. Sloppy work may result in the crime not being solved! You have to take the following steps:<br />
1. Copy/paste the "Goal of the analysis" you have written before<br /> 
2. Write a hypothesis by finishing the following sentence: “If we find a match between two DNA samples, then...”<br />
3. Describe the principle of the manipulation by using the previous step "Choice of the techniques".<br />
4. Describe what materials you are going to use during the experiment. Also specify the quantities you will use.<br />
5. Describe the experiment step by step.
