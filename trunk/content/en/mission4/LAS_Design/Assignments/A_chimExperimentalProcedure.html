<h1>Experimental procedure
</h1>
<p>You have several inks that need to be tested: one corresponds to the anonymous letter; the other ones belong to the collected pens. You have to investigate if there is a match between the ink of the anonymous letter and ink of the pens.<br />
<br />
To design your <a href="../Guidelines_expProcedure.html"target ="_moreAssignment">experimental procedure</a>, you have to take the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Drag-and-drop the icon of the "Goal of the analysis" you have written before to the "Research question" field.<br /> 
2. Write your <a href="../Guidelines_hypothesis.html"target ="_moreAssignment">hypothesis</a>.<br />
3. Describe the principle of the manipulation.<br />
4. Complete the material list with the materials you are going to use during the experiment. Don't forget to specify the capacity of each container when needed.<br />
5. Describe precisely the experiment step by step and justify all your actions in the "add a note" section inside each action.<br />
<br />
Make sure you work extremely precisely and record exactly what you are going to do. Sloppy work may result in the crime not being solved!<br />
<br />
When you  have finished, <span class="Bold">compare</span> your experimental procedure with others. For this, use the search tool (on the bottom left corner of the screen).</p>
