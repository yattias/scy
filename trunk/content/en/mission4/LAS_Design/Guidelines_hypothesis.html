<h1>What is a ‘good’ hypothesis or anticipated result? Here are some guidelines:
</h1>
<li>A hypothesis/anticipated result is a clear and concise statement which expresses the expected answer to a question.</li>
<li>A hypothesis/anticipated result has to be testable.</li>
<li>A hypothesis/anticipated result does not have to be correct;<br />
if your hypothesis/anticipated result turns out to be false, that doesn’t mean your research was not successful.</li>
<li>Many hypotheses/anticipated result are phrased as ‘if … , then …’ statements.</li>
