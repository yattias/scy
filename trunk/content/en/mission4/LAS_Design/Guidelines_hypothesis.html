<h1>What is a ‘good’ hypothesis? Here are some guidelines:
</h1>
<li>A hypothesis is a clear and concise statement which expresses the expected answer to a question.</li>
<li>A hypothesis has to be testable.</li>
<li>A hypothesis does not have to be correct;<br />
if your hypothesis turns out to be false, that doesn’t mean your research was not successful.</li>
<li>Many hypotheses are phrased as ‘if … , then …’ statements.</li>
