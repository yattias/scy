<h1>Design an experimental procedure: some guidelines
</h1>
<p>An experimental procedure is a detailed, step-by-step description of an experiment. Even when you plan to execute the experiment yourself, your experimental procedure has to be precise and clear. Another person should have enough information to perform the experiment in the same way.<br />
<br />
An experimental procedure is composed of an organized list of tasks that have to be carried out. All instructions must specify the materials that have to be used, and all parameters that define the task that has to be done (e.g. the quantities of substances, the input parameters of a device, etc.).<br />
<br />
Example of a task (materials and parameters are underlined): <br />
Measure <span class="underligned">50 mL</span> of <span class="underligned">solution S</span> with a <span class="underligned">50 mL</span> pipette.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following checklist to evaluate your experimental procedure:<br />
<br />
The experimental procedure is precise and clear.
<br />
<li>The list of tasks is complete. All parameters and materials are specified.</li>
<li>The list of tasks is structured in such a way that it is easy to understand. Tasks could be organized in steps and sub-steps.</li>
<br />
The experimental procedure is executable.<br />
<li>The chosen materials are accessible.</li>
<li>The experiment can be executed in the amount of time available.</li>
<li>Potential hazards are evaluated.</li><br />
The experiment is consistent with your research questions and hypotheses.<br />
<li>The variables described in the research question(s) correspond with the parameters that will be changed during the experiment. </li><br />
The experiment is consistent with the scientific method.<br />
<li>Only one variable will be changed at a time.</li>
<li>Errors of measurement are minimized, and sources of variance are controlled. The dispersion of the different values must be as narrow as possible.</li>
