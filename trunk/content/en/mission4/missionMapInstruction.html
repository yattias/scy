<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>.<br />
<br />
In the mission map you will find 2 parts.<br />
On the left part, your expertise will be <span class="Bold">DNA profiling</span>. Your job will be to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
Optionnaly, you will be asked to make the right part of the mission map. If so, you will be an <span class="Bold">expert in chemical analyses</span>, and your job will be to analyse and compare chemical traces of substances found in strategic locations: i.e. anonymous letter and suspect's house.<br />
<br />
In order to help you, you are provided with a handbook [hyperlink] that you can consult throughout the mission. At some points, you will be provided with webnews. They will give you clues to understand the case you actually work on.<br />
<br />
The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general.<br />
Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles or 2 chemical substances, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found?</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>

	After completion of the mission, you will have learnt a lot about biology, mathematics, chemistry and...
  		<ul><li>You can extract, organize and critically evaluate information on a definite subject.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>You can follow an experimental process to answer a question:<br />
        -	write correct hypotheses<br />
        -	design and carry out experiments related to expressed hypotheses<br />
        -	use ICT to express and exploit my results: tables, graphical representations…</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>You can take into account scientific, economic, ethical and moral standpoints. You can form an opinion on one or more personal and/or societal issues.</li>
