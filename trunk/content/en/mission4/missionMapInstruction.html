<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>. The following lessons you will work as forensic researchers, scientists that try to answer all sorts of questions related to legal issues. You will be engaged in a real investigation and will have to:
<li>give recommandation for the crime scene investigation,</li>
<li>choose the technic of analysis according to the samples you will be provided with,</li>
<li>elaborate your experimental procedure,</li>
<li>carry out the experiment and analyse your results.</li>
The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general.<br />
<br />
Your expertise is DNA profiling, and your job is to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
<br />
DNA profiling involves a lot of lab work. You have to make sure that your experimental procedure is correct, and that you work really carefully. In order to help you, you are provided with a handbook [hyperlink] that you can consult all during the mission.<br />
<br />
Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found? Your report to the judge must include a section on this issue.</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>

	After completion of the mission, you will have learnt a lot about biology, mathematics, chemistry and...
  		<ul><li>You can extract, organize and critically evaluate data on a definite subject.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>You can follow an experimental process to answer a question:<br />
        -	write correct hypotheses<br />
        -	design and carry out experiments related to expressed hypotheses<br />
        -	use ICT to express and exploit my results: tables, graphical representations…</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>You can take into account scientific, economic, ethical and moral standpoints. You can form an opinion on one or more personal and/or societal issues.</li>
