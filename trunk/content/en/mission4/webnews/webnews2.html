<h1>Brothers F. are found innocent</h1>
  
<p><strong>MENFORD </strong> - When the brothers F. were released from prison in 2007, after finishing two-thirds of their detention, they still claimed that they were innocent. Today they are finally found innocent and the brothers will receive a compensation of 1.5 million Euros.</p>
  
<p>The two brothers were convicted for murdering a woman on the basis of witness testimonials, although the most important evidence,  desquamated skin under the woman's  nails, did not match the DNA of the brothers. Because of new visions  about the found DNA material the case is reopened and the brothers are found innocent.</p>
  
<p>Now the case is reopened, it is possible to compare the DNA found with all suspect profiles in the DNA database. Hopefully this will reveal the real suspect soon.</p?
