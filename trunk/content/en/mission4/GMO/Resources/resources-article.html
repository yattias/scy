<h3>Genetically Modifed Salmon Vying for a Spot at the Dinner Table</h3>
<p>On the basis of Alice McCarthy </p>
<p>DOI 10.1016/j.chembiol.2011.01.008</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing a first: advanced hybrid salmon intended for the human food table. The fish is actually genetically modified (GM) Atlantic salmon made to reach market growth in half the time of Atlantic salmon now grown routinely in today’s aquaculture ocean-pen farms.</p>
<p>The underlying technology for producing GM Atlantic salmon was developed in 1989 by Garth Fletcher, Peter Davies, and Choy Hew (Memorial University of Newfoundland). Research papers from the team began appearing in journals in the early 1990s describing the evolution of genetically modified salmon with rapid growth curves.</p>
<p>Today’s commercial application is championed by AquaBounty Technologies, based in Waltham, MA. The company hopes to sell its AquaAdvantage genetically modified fish eggs to approved land-based growth facilities.</p>
<p>They have inserted a specific heritable gene and promoter construct into the fish eggs that allows the salmon to grow more rapidly than nontransgenic salmon (contrary to the natural Atlantic salmon not usually growing in cold periods). In effect, with a single gene addition, the fish grow more quickly. It does not make the fish grow to larger sizes, just more quickly.</p>
<p>In the first year of Atlantic salmon’s life, it does not grow much at all. Its growth, particularly its growth hormone, is regulated by sunlight, food availability, and water temperature because it is a cold water fish. In its first year, the salmon grows from an egg sack to small fry that is a few grams. Trout, by comparison, grow immediately and rapidly in the first year. AquaAdvantage salmon grows more like a trout in its first year of life. The AquaAdvantage fish reaches the desirable nearly 9 lb (4.08kg) weight limit considered prime by market standards in about 18 months compared with 30 months or more for conventionally farmed Atlantic salmon.</p>
<p>For containment and environmental reasons, the AquaAdvantage salmon is purposely made to be all female, all of which are sterile. By breeding all female fish which are also sterile—they cannot breed with other local populations in the case of escape and create self-sustaining populations.</p>
<p>Aquabounty claims that the fish’s rapid growth is not its only benefit. Contrary to farm-raised Atlantic salmon, AquaAdvantage salmon are grown in land-based systems. This would theoretically allow the fish to be cultivated locally near food consumption sites, potentially reducing the environmental impact compared with coastal-based farms. By growing them efficiently in land-based system, it is possible to regulate their environment extremely closely. This limits exposure to diseases common in communal ocean pens and provides another measure of security against to wild populations.</p>
