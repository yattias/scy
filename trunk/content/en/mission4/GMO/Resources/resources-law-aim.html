<h3>What is the aim of legislation regulating GM food and feed?</h3>

<p>In order to ensure that the development of modern biotechnology, more specifically of genetically  modified organisms (GMOs), takes place in complete safety, the European Union  has established a legal framework regulating genetically modified (GM) food and  feed in the EU. This framework pursues the global objective of ensuring a high level of protection of human life and health and welfare, environment and  consumer interests, whilst ensuring that the internal market works effectively.</p>
