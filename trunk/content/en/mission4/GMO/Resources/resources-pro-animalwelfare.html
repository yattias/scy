<h3>Animal welfare</h3>
<p>Biotechnology can be good for animals. Selective breeding and genetic engineering can benefit animals in many ways:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="1" >
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>Improving resistance to disease;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>breeding to remove characteristics that cause injury eg selecting cattle without horns.</td>
  </tr>  
</table>	
<p>But biotechnology can also be bad for animals - the good effects for the breeder can offset by painful side-effects for the animals:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="1" >
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>Modern pigs have been bred to grow extra fast - some breeds now grow too fast for their hearts, causing discomfort when animals are too active.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>Broiler chickens are bred to grow fast - some now grow too fast for their legs.</td>
  </tr>  
</table>
