<h3>Transgenic Animal Models May Increase Suffering for Research Animals</h3>
<p>Experimenting may cause great suffering for research  animals. One of the more common uses of bioengineering is for the purposeful  creation of animals who are either diseased or afflicted with a predisposition  to develop a fatal, genetic disease. Such research animals are purposefully created to suffer. The entire population of genetically  engineered research animals exist in bodies whose inevitable fate is constant  pain and unnaturally rapid deterioration. Animal rights organizations have always held that research animals are abused, badly mistreated, and without  even the most basic of rights. And, only for the benefit of human welfare.</p>
