<h3>What does the notion of species integrity stand for?</h3>
<p>Creating transgenic farm animals is considered not only threatening to natural ecosystems, but also devastating as a form of mistreatment.  This concept centers upon the notion of species integrity, the idea that every animal, whether owned by humans or not, has a natural right to have its genetic code left intact and untouched.  This notion of integrity, though calling for a complete ban on transgenic animals, centers mostly on the use of biotechnology on agricultural animals because of the widespread threat such animals pose to natural ecosystems.</p>

<p>Animals are not insentient. They are conscious beings deserving not only of protection, but deep respect and thoughtful consideration.</p>
