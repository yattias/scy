<h3>How long is the history of the usage of GMOs and why do we need them?</h3>
<p>Although the usage of GMOs is not very long, there are already several GMOs, which have been made available. At first, GM vaccines came on the market (1992-1994), which were followed by the herbicide resistant tobacco (1994) and, in 1996-1997, several GM rape, soya, corn and flowers. Nowadays, the most common GM crops are: soya bean, corn, cotton and rape. The first GM animal was a mouse and the first GM animal commercialized as a novel pet was a Glofish (transgenic zebrafish). There are two GM animals designed for human consumption – an AquaAdvantage salmon (AquaBounty, Waltham, MA, USA) and EnviroPig (University of Guelph). GM salmon grows faster than its natural relatives and GM pig produces 30% less phosphorus in its manure than other pigs. From economical point of view, the most usable GMOs besides GM bacteria and yeast are GM plants and some GM animals. There are three big GMO breeders in the world – the USA, Canada and Argentina.</p>

<p>Food prices are rising, although a big part of the world is struggling with starvation linked to poverty. Proponents of GMOs claim that the agriculture, based on GMOs, may be the one and only way out of widespread starvation. Researchers have shown that GMO crops are as safe as other crops for human consumption. It has been demonstrated by over 3 trillion platefuls of food containing GMOs, which have been eaten. GM crops are resistant to drought and excessive rainfall; they require fewer fertilisers and, ultimately, save land and fuel.</p>
