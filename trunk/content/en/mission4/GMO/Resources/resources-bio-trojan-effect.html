<h3>What does the ‘Trojan gene effect’ mean?</h3>

<p>The genetic modifications that improve animals for human consumption also could doom populations if released into the wild, according to a Purdue University research team.</p>

<p>A biologist Rick Howard and his colleagues have discovered a paradox that crops up when new genes are deliberately inserted into a fish’s chromosomes to make the animal grow larger. While the genetically modified fish will be bigger and have more success at attracting mates, they may also produce offspring that are less likely to survive to adulthood. If this occurs, as generations pass, a population could dwindle in size and, potentially, disappear entirely. The research team confirmed that theirs was the first demonstration that a genetically modified organism has a reproductive advantage over its natural counterpart. Though altering animals’ genes can be good for humans in the short run, it may prove catastrophic for nature in the long run if not done with care. And we do not know just what kind of care is necessary yet, or how much.</p>

<p>For the experiment, they took several tanks and put a female into each one with two males – one natural, and one transgenic. The transgenic males were 83 per cent heavier than the natural-bred males, so it was easy to distinguish which male was mating with the female. From the experiment, they found that the larger transgenic males mated three times for every time the natural-bred males did – not surprising, considering the premium that females place on male size. But though the transgenic males mated more often, fewer of their young survived to adulthood.</p>
<p>The research team was surprised how fast a GMO  mating advantage could cause a transgene to spread in a population. They observed  that for every 100 offspring sired by a natural male that survived to  adulthood, only 70 of the young produced by a transgenic male survived. </p>
Considering both  these aspects, a population invaded by a few genetically modified individuals  would become more and more transgenic, and this results in the population getting  smaller and smaller. Scientists call this the ‘Trojan gene effect’. Over time,  this effect could continue to multiply itself over generations, eventually  decimating a population.</p>
