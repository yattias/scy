<h3>How do genetic engineering and selective breeding violate animal rights?</h3>
<p>Genetic engineering and selective breeding appear to violate animal rights, because they involve manipulating animals for human ends as if animals were nothing more than human property rather than regarding animals as being of value in themselves. Recent action to allow animals to be patented reinforces the idea of animals as human property, rather than beings in their own right.</p>
