<h3>Regulation (EC) 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of GMOs and the traceability of food and feed products produced from GMOs.</h3>
<p>Food and feed must carry a label which refers to the presence of GMOs. However, these labelling requirements do not apply to food/feed which contains, consists of, or is produced from GMOs in a proportion no higher than 0.9 % of the food/feed ingredients considered individually and if this presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable.</p>

<p>Labelling provides information for consumers and allows them to make an informed choice. In the case of pre-packaged products consisting of, or containing, GMOs, the list of ingredients must indicate &quot;genetically modified&quot; or &quot;produced from genetically modified [name of the organism]&quot;. In the case of products without packaging these words must still be clearly displayed in close proximity to the product (such as a note on the supermarket shelf).</p>
