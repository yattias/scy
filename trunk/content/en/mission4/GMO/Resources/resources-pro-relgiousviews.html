<h3>Religious views of transgenic animals</h3>
<p>Against transgenic animals:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="1" >
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>God laid down the structure of creation and any tampering with it is sinful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>Manipulating DNA is manipulating 'life itself' - and this is tampering with something that God did not intend humanity to meddle with.</td>

<p>In favour of transgenic animals:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="1" >
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>As human beings have been given 'dominion' over the animals, they are entitled to tamper with them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>Palaeontology shows that the structure of creation has changed over time as some species became extinct and new ones came into being. They say that this shows that there is nothing fixed about the structure of creation.</td>
