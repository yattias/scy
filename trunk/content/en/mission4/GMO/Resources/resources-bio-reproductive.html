<h3>Reproductive advantage</h3>
<p>The genetic modifications that improve animals for human consumption also could doom populations if released into the wild, according to a Purdue University research team.</p>

<p>Biologist Rick Howard and his colleagues have discovered a paradox that crops up when new genes are deliberately inserted into a fish’s chromosomes to make the animal grow larger. While the genetically modified fish will be bigger and have more success at attracting mates, they may also produce offspring that are less likely to survive to adulthood. If this occurs, as generations pass, a population could dwindle in size and, potentially, disappear entirely.</p> 

<p>&quot;Ours is the first demonstration that a genetically modified organism has a reproductive advantage over its natural counterpart,&quot; said Howard, a professor of biological sciences in Purdue’s School of Science. &quot;Though altering animals’ genes can be good for humans in the short run, it may prove catastrophic for nature in the long run if not done with care. And we don’t know just what kind of care is necessary yet, or how much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We took several tanks and put a female into each one with two males – one natural, and one transgenic,&quot; Howard said. &quot;The transgenic males were 83 percent heavier than the natural-bred males, so it was easy to distinguish which male was mating with the female.&quot;</p> 

<p>Howard found that the larger transgenic males mated three times for every time the natural-bred males did – not surprising, considering the premium that female medakas place on male size. But though the transgenic males mated more often, fewer of their young survived to adulthood.</p> 

<p>&quot;What surprised us was how fast a GMO mating advantage could cause a transgene to spread in a population,&quot; Howard said. &quot;Additionally, we were intrigued at the outcome predicted if this advantage was combined with the disadvantage of young with reduced survival ability.&quot;</p> 

<p>Howard observed that for every 100 offspring sired by a natural male that survived to adulthood, only 70 of the young produced by a transgenic male survived.</p>

<p>&quot;Putting both of these things together, a population invaded by a few genetically modified individuals would become more and more transgenic, and as it did the population would get smaller and smaller,&quot; he said. &quot;We call this the ‘Trojan gene effect.’&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over time,&quot; continued Howard, &quot;this effect could continue to multiply itself over generations, eventually decimating a population.&quot;</p>
