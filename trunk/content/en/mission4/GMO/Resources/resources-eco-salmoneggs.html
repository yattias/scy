<h3>Salmon Eggs</h3>
<p>Aqua Bounty, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, aims to sell GM salmon eggs to companies that would raise them in enclosed facilities such as land-based tanks. The gene-altered fish can grow to &quot;market weight&quot; of up to six kilograms (13.2 pounds) in two or three years, Ronald Stotish, chief executive officer of Aqua Bounty, said today in an interview. Natural Atlantic salmon take three to four years to reach that size, he said.</p>

<p>Aqua Bounty’s Atlantic salmon eggs contain a growth-hormone gene, from Chinook salmon, that is activated with a genetic &quot;on-off&quot; switch from an eel-like fish, the ocean pout. The modified fish, all female, are sterile, Stotish said. The company would sell the eggs only to people who agree to keep the fish isolated from wild salmon populations, and whose facilities have been inspected by the FDA, he said.</p>

<p>Stotish said 97 percent of the total tonnage of salmon now consumed in the U.S. is imported. While it’s too early to project the AquAdvantage eggs’ sales potential, he said the fast-growing fish could help domestic salmon fisheries gain a larger share of the market. Almost 427,000 tons of salmon, valued at $1.39 billion, were imported last year from countries led by Chile, Canada and Norway, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.</p>

<p>Genetically engineered plants have been used in food for more than 20 years, according to the FDA.</p>
