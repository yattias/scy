<h3>Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs.</h3>
<p>The main aim of this Directive is to make the procedure for granting consent for the deliberate release and placing on the market of GMOs more efficient and more transparent, to limit such consent to a period of ten years (renewable) and to introduce compulsory monitoring after GMOs have been placed on the market.</p>
