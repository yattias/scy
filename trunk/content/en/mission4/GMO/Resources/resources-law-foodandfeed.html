<h3>GM food and feed</h3>
In order to ensure that the development of modern biotechnology, and more specifically of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), takes place in complete safety, the European Union has established a legal framework regulating genetically modified (GM) food and feed in the EU. This framework pursues the global objective of ensuring a high level of protection of human life and health and welfare, environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring that the internal market works effectively.
