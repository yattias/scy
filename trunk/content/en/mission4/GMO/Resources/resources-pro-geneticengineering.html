<h3>Genetic engineering</h3>
<p>With the advent and rapid development of genetic engineering technology, the animal rights movement is currently facing one of its greatest challenges and dilemmas. Transgenic animals, i.e., engineered to carry genes from other species, have the potential to improve human welfare in several aspects.</p>

<p>Unlike controlled breeding, which is confined to the genetic material contained in a single species, genetic engineering permits an almost limitless scope of modification and introduction of otherwise foreign genetic material.  Traditional methods, which could only breed with two closely related species, produced offspring that carried a diverse amalgamation of each of its parent's traits.  In contrast, modern genetic engineers are able to introduce completely foreign genetic material, from both plants and animals, into another plant or animal.  This permits only the desired traits, and not the host of other traits common from crossbreeding, to be effectively introduced into new, transgenic animal species. Eventually genetic engineers will be able to manufacture genes that nature has never produced. Regardless, genetic engineering is currently able to create whole organisms that are not natural to the planet, and whose specific genetic make-up is as much a result of human manipulation as it is natural selection. Thus, the ethical, cultural, and environmental implications involve issues of the greatest magnitude and importance.</p>
