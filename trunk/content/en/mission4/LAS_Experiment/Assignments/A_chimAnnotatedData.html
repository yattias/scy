<h1>Results of the experiment
</h1>
<p>To keep a trace of your results, take a picture of the TLC plate(s) and upload it (them) in your computer. Then, use the uploader button of the drawing tool and click anywhere in the window tool. Annotate the picture(s) with arrows and/or small textboxes to indicate:
<br />
- which inks have been deposed on the chromatography plate,<br />
- what are the conditions of the experiment<br />
<br />
<span class="Bold">If you don't have a camera</span>, use the tool to draw the TLC plate(s) before making your annotation.<br />
<br />
If you want to ensure the reliability, it is better to perform several times your experiment.</p>
