<h1>Annotation on the results</h1>
<p>To keep a trace of your results, take a picture of your gel and upload it in your computer. Then, use the uploader button of the drawing tool and click anywhere in the window tool. Annotate the picture with arrows and/or small textboxes to indicate:
<li>which DNA-profile belongs to which donor (the sample found at the crime scene, the victim, suspect A, etc.)</li>
<li>which side of the gel contains the smaller DNA fragments, and which side contains the larger fragments,</li>
<li>which side of the gel was positively charged, and which side was negatively charged.</li><br />
<span class="Bold">If you don't have a camera</span>, use the tool to draw your gel before making your annotation.</p>
