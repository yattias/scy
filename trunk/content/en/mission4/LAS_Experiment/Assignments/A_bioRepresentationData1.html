<h1>Visual representation of data

<p>The result of the last step in your experiment – gel electrophoresis – is a gel with band patterns. To make your results accessible and understandable for the people in the courtroom, you will take the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Take a picture of the gel with a digital camera or your mobile phone.<br />
2. Upload the picture onto your computer. Then upload the picture into this drawing tool. See <span class="external">here</span> [hyperlink to ‘how to take a picture’] if you need further instructions.<br />
3. Annotate the picture with arrows and/or small textboxes to indicate:
<li>which DNA-profile belongs to which donor (the sample found at the crime scene, the victim, suspect A, etc.)</li>
<li>which side of the gel contains the smaller DNA fragments, and which side contains the larger fragments,</li>
<li>which side of the gel was positively charged, and which side was negatively charged.</li>
