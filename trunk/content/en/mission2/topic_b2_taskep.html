<h1>Making experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Plan an experiment where you study the effect of the light intensity on the oxygen concentration in water produced by plant. You have to use a light sensor and an oxygen probe to measure light intensity and concentration of oxygen in water.</p>
<p>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</p>
<p>There is a special tool in SCY-Lab that supports you in this process but you can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a>.</p>
