<h1>Designing an experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Plan and perform an experiment where you study the effect of the light intensity on the oxygen concentration produced by plants in water. You need to use a light sensor and an oxygen probe to measure the light intensity and the concentration of oxygen in the water.</p>
<h3>Some tips!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Don’t use common energy saver bulbs! The light spectrum of energy savers is not appropriate for photosynthesis.</li>
	<li>Shut the curtains and turn off the lights in your room during the experiment.</li>
	<li>Collect the water from the tap very slowly in a beaker. There should be no air bubbles.</li>
	<li>The water should be at room temperature (18-23 °C).</li>
</ul>
