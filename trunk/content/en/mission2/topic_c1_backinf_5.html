<h1 class="mainTitle">Influence of pH on aquatic life</h1>
<p>As it was said earlier, serious fluctuations of pH in aquatic ecosystems can cause severe damage to organisms living there. One factor which lowers the pH of water bodies is acid rain. The term ‘acid rain’ refers to any form of precipitation such as rain, fog, snow or hail which contains nitric and sulphuric acids. These acids form in the air from nitrogen and sulphur oxides emitted by industry, transportation and power plants or derived from several natural resources.</p> 
<p>Aquatic organisms require the pH of water to be within an optimal range in order to grow and survive. Most aquatic organisms prefer a pH ranging from 6.5 – 8.0. Outside of this range reproduction can suffer and species can even become extinct if the pH differs greatly from the optimal values for supporting their growth. In addition to that, low pH can cause the release into the water of toxic metals and compounds from sediments. Changes in pH also have influence on the availability of plant nutrients (phosphate, ammonia, iron).</p>
