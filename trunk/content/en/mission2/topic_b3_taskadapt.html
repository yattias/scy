<h1>Applying data processing tool in order to make inferences</h1>
<p> You have already recorded the population sizes of the prey and predator populations. You can now use the Data Processing Tool and construct a graph depicting the change of the prey and predator population sizes in time. Plot the time (10 units of time) on the X-axis. Plot both populations (i.e., the prey and predator population) on the same Y-axis, so that you can compare their change in time. In order to do so, you have to set the scale for the Y-axis. Find the maximum and minimum value of population sizes for both populations. These extreme values should define the range of the Y-axis. </p>
