<h1 class="mainTitle">Trophic levels</h1>
<p>Collections of organisms which present the same feeding habits correspond to trophic levels. Putting one trophic level upon the other, we can obtain an ecological pyramid, which can be used to describe the composition of an ecosystem as far as its biotic components are concerned. By looking at any ecological pyramid, we can easily discern that the size of subsequent trophic levels decreases steadily from the bottom to the top of the pyramid. This decrease is to be attributed to the energy transfer from each trophic level to the next, which is facilitated by food consumption. Energy transferred to the next trophic level is always less compared to the energy introduced in the former trophic level. Organisms need to expend energy to stay alive, undertake all their activities, and reproduce. Therefore, energy left after removing all energy losses, is always a fraction of energy introduced in a trophic level through food consumption. It has been calculated that about 10% of the energy stored in each trophic level is transferred to the next trophic level.</p>
