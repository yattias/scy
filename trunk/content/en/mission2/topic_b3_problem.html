<h1>Problem presentation</h1>
<p>Otto and Sylvia are classmates and dedicated fishers. They use to go fishing in a lake that is a biotope for a number of fish species. Some of them are predators, such as pikes; some other fish are prey, such as roaches. Sylvia realized that last month there were more roaches than pikes among the fish they caught, but this month they have caught more pikes than roaches. According to Otto, this is quite a peculiar finding. In their biology course, at school, they were taught that the trophic levels in an ecosystem can be represented by a pyramid of numbers, biomass, or energy. In the pyramid, the tiers decrease in size as you move from the bottom to the top. Based on this knowledge, Otto expected that pikes, being a predator species, should be less numerous than roaches, which are a prey species. Provided that the fish they have caught are representative of the population sizes of roaches and pikes in the lake, this month pikes were more abundant than roaches. They discussed their observation with local fishermen, who replied that differences in population sizes such as the one found by Sylvia and Otto are quite common, and that these differences are not related to human intervention (e.g., fishermen's catches). How can Otto and Sylvia explain their finding?</p>
