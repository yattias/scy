<h1 class="mainTitle">Eutrophication</h1>
<p>Nowadays, many freshwater ecosystems worldwide (e.g. lakes and ponds) suffer from a problem known as eutrophication. Eutrophication is defined as an increase in the nutrient levels in an aquatic ecosystem. Eutrophication is often caused by human agricultural or domestic activity. As a result of the rise in the concentration of nutrients, the number of certain species of primary producers (mainly algae and cyanobacteria) considerably increases. But the success of this small number of fast-growing species has serious effects on other abiotic factors, such as the transparency of the water (eutrophication usually decreases the amount of sunlight arriving at deeper layers of the water) and the availability of oxygen (during the night, all plants use oxygen). Thus, while some algae flourish, other species of plants, zooplankton and fish suffer the consequences. The effects of eutrophication may be profound, extending to a severe drop in species diversity, a decrease in water transparency, and the occurrence of algal blooms (exuberant growth of a potentially toxic species of alga or cyanobacterium).</p>
<p>A water body that suffers from eutrophication may be &quot;cured&quot;, e.g. by considerably reducing the amount of nutrients in the system. But this is not so easy. It turns out that there are two distinct, stable equilibria. There is one state in which the water is relatively clear, and there are different species of fish and water plants and relatively few algae; and there is another (eutrophied) state in which the water is turbid, and algae are very abundant, but few fish or water plants survive. Both system states are more or less stable and resilient. When abiotic conditions (predominantly the amount of nutrients in the system) change, the ecosystem might shift from one state to the other. Remarkably, the turning-point is dependent on the direction of the development. The level of nutrients at which a clear lake turns into a turbid one is higher than the level of nutrients that must be reached to turn the turbid lake back into its clear state. The existence of these so-called 'stable states' was first demonstrated in shallow lakes. Since then, the phenomenon has been identified in a number of other ecosystems as well.</p>
