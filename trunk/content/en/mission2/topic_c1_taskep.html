<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<p>In order to see if your hypotheses are correct, you have to run experiments. In your experiments, you will examine the influence of different types of soil on the pH of water. You will also research which types of soil act as buffers and contribute to the maintenance of a stable pH for water even if a certain amount of acid is added.</p>
<p>Begin by planning your experiment carefully.</p>
<p>Design an experimental procedure. An experimental procedure is a step-by-step description of your experiment, containing a list of activities that have to be done and the materials that are to be used and in what quantities.</p>

<h3>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</h3>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process. First, open your hypotheses and copy them to the hypotheses field of your experimental procedure. If you cannot find your previously formulated research questions and hypotheses with the tools and equipment available, please revise them and write your updated research questions and hypotheses in the Experimental procedure ELO. You can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a> for planning experiments.</p>
