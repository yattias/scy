<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<p>In order to see, if your hypotheses are correct, you have to run some experiments. In your experiments, you will examine the influence of different types of ground on pH of water. Also you will research which types of ground act as buffers and contribute to maintenance of a stable pH of water even if an amount of acid is added.</p>
<p>Good scientists plan their experiments in advance, in order to have a clear vision what is going to happen and what kind of equipment and materials are needed. Please follow this good practice.</p>
<p>Now your task is to compose an experimental procedure. An experimental procedure is a step by step description of your experiment, containing a list of activities that have to be done and the materials which are to be used and in which quantities.</p>
<h3>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</h3>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process but you can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a>.</p>
