<p>Now it is time to draw your conclusions and to solve the problem. To help you, here are some guidelines;</p>
<ul><li>If your hypothesis turns out to be correct, you can move on to other research questions. Sometimes your data will also give rise to new research questions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If your hypothesis turns out to be incorrect, this doesn’t mean that your entire research was unsuccessful. Knowing that your hypothesis was false is also ‘new knowledge’. Sometimes it is possible to answer your research question right away. In other cases, it is necessary to construct a new hypothesis and to design and run new experiments.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Another conclusion might be that your data are insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. In that case, it might be a good idea to change your experimental design and / or run more experiments.</li></ul>
