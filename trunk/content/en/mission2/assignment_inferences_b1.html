<p>Inferences can be formulated on the basis of what you observed by running the SCYDynamics model. You can rely on either a data table or a graph. The structure of a good inference is the same as that of a hypothesis.</p>
<p>The experiment often sets some limitations for interpreting the results and making inferences. Please think about your modelling experiment and describe what limitations need to be taken into account with regard to your inferences, i.e., they are valid only for certain species, etc.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for making inferences:</h3>
<ul><li>An inference is a clear and concise answer to a research question derived from data analysis.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The structure of an inference is similar to the structure of a hypothesis: it relates dependent and independent variables and describes how a dependent variable is influenced by an independent variable (see <a href="guidelines_h.html" target="_MoreResources">guidelines</a> for formulating hypotheses).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many inferences are phrased as ‘if … , then … ’ statements.</li></ul>
