<p>Now you have read the story about Kevin and Anna, who are puzzled about why acid rain does not have the same effect on aquatic life in Estonia as they do in Sweden. Acidification of water bodies due to acid rain has been linked to disappearance of fish not only in Sweden, but also in Norway and Scotland. Whereas there were no evidence of such impact further south in Europe, although inputs of acid rain being higher than in Scandinavia. Your task is to find out the reasons why acid rain raises the acidity of water in some countries, whereas in other countries pH of water bodies remains stable despite of acid rain. Firstly, you should do some additional background reading. Secondly, you should formulate the problem in your own words, using the knowledge you received from your additional reading.</p>
