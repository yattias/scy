<h1>Problem presentation</h1>
<p>Otto and Anna have been pen-pals for several years. Anna lives in Sweden and Otto in Estonia. Estonia is known for its limestone banks. During her summer vacation, Anna visited Otto in Estonia. They decided to go trout fishing to a lake near Otto’s home village. On their way to the lake, Anna told Otto that there were some lakes in Sweden with transparent pure water and beautiful granite stones on the bottom, but no fish – that was due to acid rain. Anna was curious if there was acid rain in Estonia. Otto said that they did have acid rain in Estonia, like in other countries. Anna was really surprised. How was this possible, to have acid rain and still have trout in the lake? Shouldn’t the acidic precipitation inhibit the fishes' spawning? Otto started thinking about it. Indeed, how could trout survive despite the acid rain?</p>
