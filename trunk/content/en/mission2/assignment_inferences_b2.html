<p>Open the data processing tool and analyse the collected data from your experiments. Make your inference.</p>
<p>Often the experimental setup sets some limitations for interpreting the results and making inferences. Describe what limitations need to be taken into account in relation to your inferences, i.e., they are valid only for certain species of plants, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Guidelines for making inferences:</h3>
  <ul><li>An inference is a clear and concise answer to a research question, derived from data analysis.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>The structure of an inference is similar to the structure of a hypothesis: it specifies dependent and independent variables and describes how a dependent variable is influenced by an independent variable (see <a href="guidelines_h.html" target="_moreResources">guidelines</a> for formulating hypotheses).</li></ul>
  <ul><li>Many inferences are phrased as ‘if ..., then ...’ statements.</li>
</ul>
