<p>In this mission you are going to perform up to four experiments to learn more about aquatic ecosystems. For each experiment you will record a 5 minute long video report (in a group with other students) that explains to other students the experiment you have done. Every video should contain the following chapters:</p>
<p>1.	Explain the <b>problem</b> addressed by your research. Provide some general background information.</p>
<p>2.	State clearly your <b>research questions and hypotheses</b>.</p>
<p>3.	Film and describe the actual <b>experiment</b> and its set-up, or show the computer model you have been working on.</p>
<p>4.	Discuss the <b>results</b> of your experiments and incorporate video stills of the graphs and figures you have created.</p>
<p>5.	Discuss the main <b>conclusions</b> of your investigations; make some references to the general problem you were trying to solve.</p>
<p>Before recording your video, create an initial story board to guide you.</p>
