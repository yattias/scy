<h1>Making experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Before conducting the game simulation, you need to describe the various actions you are going to perform in order to run your experiment. The sequence of the steps you are going to follow is called experimental procedure. The description of the experimental procedure should be detailed. Another person should have enough guidance to run the same experiment by following the same procedure. You will use the Experimental Design Tool in SCY-Lab. The Tool will request your research questions and hypotheses, which you have already formulated. Then, you will describe the general principle of your experiment, where you will need to specify the variables you will examine during the experiment.
Note that you have to specify your dependent variable (i.e., the parameter, which corresponds to the observed result of the experiment) and one or more independent variables (i.e., parameters you will manipulate in order to observe their impact on the dependent variable). For example, we can investigate the impact of various quantities of water, which will be supplied to a plant (independent variable: water supply measured in litres) to the development of the plant measured in terms of plant height (dependent variable: plant height measured in centimetres).</p>
<p>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</p>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process but you can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a>.</p>
