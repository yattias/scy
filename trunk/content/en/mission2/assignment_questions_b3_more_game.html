<h3>Formulating research questions (game simulation)</h3>
<p>In the former step, you formulated a number of research questions concerning the game modelling. You might be already able to guess the outcome of the game modelling, namely, you might be able to write down your expectations about the results of the game modelling. These ideas will represent a possible answer to your research questions. In the frame of scientific inquiry, these expectations are termed 'hypotheses‘. As was the case with research questions, hypotheses attempt to relate measurable variables. This means that hypotheses need to include variables which should be measurable through the game modelling. In the case of hypotheses, however, the formulation follows the type of 'if…, then…' statements (e.g., 'If variable 1 increases, then variable 2 decreases'). This type of formulation is preferred because hypotheses formulated as 'if…, then…' statements can be either confirmed or rejected, which adds to the validity and reliability of the experimental procedure.</p>
<p>Note that the proper organization of the experimental procedure does not presuppose the confirmation of your hypotheses. Many scientific experiments led to valuable knowledge exactly because they led to the rejection of a hypothesis (e.g., rejection of an expected side-effect of a medicine).</p>
<p>Now you have to formulate your research questions.</p>
