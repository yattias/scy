<p>In order to test if your previously stated hypotheses are correct, you have to run some experiments. 
Here you can compose the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Experimental procedure. First you have to plan your experiment. For that, open the “Experimental procedure” ELO and follow all the instructions related to the ELO.</p>
<p>2. Data collection. After your experimental procedure is finished, you can start performing your experiments. For that, open the ELO “SCYDynamics model” and follow the guidelines about conducting experiments.</p>
<p>3. Data analysis. Open Data processing tool and analyze the data collected from your experiments.</p>
<p>4. Formulating inferences. Open the “Inference” ELO and make your inferences.</p>
<p>After formulating your inferences, open the mission map and move next to the “Solution” space.

	After successfully completing the assignments, you are able to act as a researcher and:
	<ul>	
 	  <li>plan experiments for testing your hypotheses;</li>
	  <li>carry out virtual experiments by dynamic modelling;</li>
	  <li>analyse, visualise and interpret data gathered from your experiments;</li>
	  <li>relate your research findings with the hypotheses and formulate inferences;</li>
	  <li>effectively collaborate with peers.</li>
