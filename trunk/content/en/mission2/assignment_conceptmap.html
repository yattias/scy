<p>An aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem located in a body of water. There live communities of organisms that are dependent on each other and on their environment. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p><b>Make your own freshwater ecosystem</b> as a concept map by adding the factors that control the dynamics of the system (influencing factors, dependent factors, determining factors and outline environmental functions).</p>
<p>When you have completed your initial concept map, then save it using name &quot;MyName_initial&quot;. After that start with your first inquiry cycle and come back when it is finished. Then develop further your initial concept map and save it again with a new name &quot;MyName_final&quot;. The final concept map could be developed after each inquiry cycle.</p>
