<p>An aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem located in a body of water. Communities of organisms that are dependent on each other and on their environment live there. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p><b>Make your own freshwater ecosystem</b> as a concept map by adding the factors that control the dynamics of the system (influencing factors, dependent factors, determining factors) and outlining the relations between them.</p>
<p>Create an initial concept map before you begin with the mission. You can find a manual on making a concept map under the resources tab.</p>
<p>When you have completed your initial concept map, save it with the following name: &quot;MyName_initial&quot;. After that, begin with your first inquiry cycle. Come back here when youâ€™re finished. Add your new knowledge to the concept map and save it under a new name:  &quot;MyName_final&quot;.</p>
