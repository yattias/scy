<p>Open the data processing tool and analyse the data collected from your experiments and make your inference. A good inference has the same structure as a hypothesis.</p>

<p>The experiment often sets some limitations for interpreting the results and making inferences. Please think over your experiment and describe what limitations must be taken into account with regard to your inferences, i.e., they are valid only for certain species of plants, etc.</p>

<h3> Guidelines for making inferences:</h3>
<ul><li>An inference is a clear and concise answer to research question derived from data analysis.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The structure of an inference is similar to the structure of a hypothesis: it relates dependent and independent variable and describes how the dependent variable is influenced by the independent variable (see more in the <a href="guidelines_h.html" target=":_MoreResources">guidelines</a> for formulating hypotheses).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many inferences are phrased as ‘if … , then … ’ statements.</li></ul>
