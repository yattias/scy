<h1>Formulating the problem</h1>
<p>You have read the story of Otto and Sylvia, having difficulty catching any fish in the green lake. The story of Otto and Sylvia is made-up. But the problem of the green lakes is real: many freshwater bodies in Europe and other continents are currently in a state where algae are very abundant, but where there are hardly any fish anymore. Your job is to find out what <em>abiotic component</em> makes the algae grow so abundantly. First, do some <a href="topic_b1_back.html">background reading</a>. Second, take a look at the dynamic model that has been created for you to carry out your experiments. Probably you will not understand the ins and outs of this model right away. A good starting point is to find out what are the variables used in this model. If you are going to work with SCYDynamics for the first time, it is a good idea to complete this <a href="manual_scydyn.html">introductory task</a> first.</p> 
<p>After you have become acquainted with the most important terms and concepts related to the phenomenon of the green lakes, try to formulate the main problem in your own words (50 words maximum).</p>
