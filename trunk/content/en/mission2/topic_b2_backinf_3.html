    <h1 class="mainTitle">Photosynthesis</h1>
    <p>Photosynthesis is a process that converts inorganic carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds, especially sugars, using the energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and many species of bacteria. Photosynthetic organisms are called photoautotrophs, because they can create their own food. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. Photosynthesis is vital for all aerobic life on Earth. Not only does it maintain the normal level of oxygen in the atmosphere, nearly all life also depends on it either directly as a source of energy, or indirectly as the ultimate source of the energy in food.</p>

    <p>The Figure 1 shows an overview of the cycle of matter between autotrophs and heterotrophs. Photosynthesis is the main means by which plants, algae and many bacteria produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water (green arrow).</p>
    <p>Photosynthesis changes the energy from the sun into chemical energy, and splits water to liberate O<sub>2</sub> and fixes CO<sub>2</sub> into sugar. Figure 2 shows a simple overview of the chemical processes in photosynthesis.</p>
