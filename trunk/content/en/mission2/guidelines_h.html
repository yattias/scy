      <td>First, you should identify the variables which will be included in the hypothesis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">2.</td>
      <td>Then, you need to distinguish between dependent and independent variables. The former correspond to the observed result of experiments, while the latter are parameters you manipulate to observe their impact on dependent variables.</td>

	  <td width="15">3.</td>
      <td>After you have distinguished between dependent and independent variables, you should specify the interrelation between them, namely, you should note which independent variables will influence which dependent ones.</td>

  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">4.</td>
      <td>You can now formulate a hypothesis in the form of an ‘if…then’ statement, which will link one dependent variable with at least one independent variable. An example of an ‘if…then’ statement is: ‘If the independent variable B increases, then the dependent variable A will decrease’.</td>

  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">6.</td>
      <td>If there are more than one independent variables which influence the dependent variable you can include them all in the experimental procedure. However, you have to change only one independent variable at a time and keep all other independent variables unchanged, so that you can be sure that the influence you measure on the dependent variable can be attributed to the independent variable you have manipulated. In this case, your ‘if…then’ statement will be of the following form: ‘If the independent variable B increases and all other independent variables are kept unchanged, then the dependent variable A will decrease’.</td>
    </tr>
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">7.</td>
      <td>Note that the proper organization of the experimental procedure does not presuppose the confirmation of your hypotheses. Many scientific experiments led to valuable knowledge exactly because they led to the rejection of a hypothesis (e.g., rejection of an expected side-effect of a medicine).</td>
    </tr>
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">8.</td>
      <td>It could be that the outcome of the experimental procedure includes observations which might have not been addressed by the hypothesis you have formulated. If you want to integrate these unanticipated outcomes in the experimental procedure, you should follow the guidelines for the formulation of hypothesis from the beginning. Namely, you should identify variables (1), distinguish between dependent and independent variables (2), specify the interrelation between them (3), formulate a hypothesis in the form of an ‘if…then’ statement (4), and proceed to a new experimentation to test your new hypothesis (5).</td>
    </tr>
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">9.</td>
      <td>Even if you have formulated a hypothesis of which you were very confident that it would be confirmed, there is always the possibility that your results do not support it. You should then think about the formulation of new hypotheses. This is exactly the way science proceeds, ideas that seem very solid are rejected or replaced by better ideas.</td>
