<p>Here you can compose your concept map about freshwater ecosystems. Please follow all the instructions given here. When you have completed your initial concept map, you can start with your first inquiry cycle. You will come back to this space when you have finished an inquiry cycle to complete your concept map with the new knowledge you have gained during your adventure. The concept map should be developed after each inquiry cycle.
