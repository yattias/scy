<p>Formulate the main problem presented in this situation in your own words.</p>
<p>It should be based on the story you already read. If you did not already read it, read it <a href="topic_b3_problem.html" target="_moreAssignment">here</a>.</p>
<p>The point is: Otto and Sylvia are facing a paradoxical situation, because they observed that pikes (predator species) might outnumber roaches (prey species). Your task is to help Otto and Sylvia explain their observation. First, you can do some reading on the most important topics from the background theory concerning relationships between trophic levels in an ecosystem, characteristics of aquatic ecosystems, and prey-predator interactions. Then, you can browse a series of websites that illustrate these concepts. After you become familiar with the most important aspects of these phenomena, you will try to formulate the main problem that you will address.</p>
