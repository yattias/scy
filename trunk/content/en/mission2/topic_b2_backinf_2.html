    <h1 class="mainTitle">Light</h1>
    <p>Almost all of the energy that drives the various systems (climate systems, ecosystems, hydrologic systems, etc.) found on the Earth originates from the sun. Solar energy is created at the core of the sun when hydrogen atoms are fused into helium by nuclear fusion. What we call light is what is visible for to us. Visible light is the light that humans can see. Other animals can see different types of light. Dogs can see only shades of gray and some insects can see light from the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The key thing to remember is that our light is what scientists call visible light.</p>
    <p>Scientists also call light electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is only one small portion of a family of waves called electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The entire spectrum of these EM waves includes radio waves, which have very long wavelengths and both gamma rays and cosmic rays, which are at the other end of the spectrum and have very small wavelengths. Visible light is near the middle of the spectrum.</p>
    <p>The key thing to remember is that light and EM radiation carry energy. The quantum theory suggests that light consists of very small bundles of energy/particles; it's just that simple. Scientists call those small particles photons, and the wavelength determines the energy and type of EM radiation, and the number of photons tells you how much radiation there is. A lot of photons give a brighter, more intense type of light. Fewer photons give a very dim and less intense light. When you use the dimmer switch on the wall, you are decreasing the number of photons sent from the light bulb. The type of light is the same while the amount has changed.
