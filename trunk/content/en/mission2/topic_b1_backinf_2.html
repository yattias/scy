<h1 class="mainTitle">Nutrients</h1>
<p>All substances that an organism needs in order to live and grow are called nutrients. In aquatic ecology, the term is often used to indicate the amount of phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in the system. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) may also be considered nutrients, but these are usually very abundant, while phosphate and nitrate are often limiting factors. Phosphate and nitrate are important components of the phosphorus cycle (P) and the nitrogen cycle (N) respectively. These cycles are complex, and comprise many different inorganic and organic molecules, in which either of these elements (or both) are present. In the context of our mission, it is important to realize that plants (producers) use phosphorus and nitrogen for the production of proteins, nucleotides (DNA) and other organic molecules. Thus, in absence of nitrogen and phosphorus a plant cannot grow.</p>
<p>What is the relation between nutrient concentration and the rate of primary production? A good framework for thinking about this relationship is the so-called &quot;range of tolerance&quot;. Organisms can live within a range of (abiotic) conditions. For instance, if we regard a temperature gradient, there will be two values – a minimum temperature and an maximum temperature – that set the upper and lower limits for a species' survival. Below the minimum and above the maximum, organisms will experience too much physiological stress to survive. Somewhere in between the minimum and the maximum is the optimum range, where the temperature for this particular species is most favourable.</p>
<p>In case of each nutrient that is necessary for primary production, there is also a range of tolerance. Below certain a concentration, an organism will suffer from certain deficiency symptoms (see figure below). On the other end of the spectrum, high concentrations of a specific nutrient may have toxic effects on the organism (but under natural circumstances this is not very common). The concentrations below which plants show symptoms of deficiency differ from nutrient to nutrient. For example, plants usually need higher amounts of nitrogen than phosphate. There are also differences between different species: some plants can cope with scarcity better than others.</p>
