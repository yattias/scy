<h1 class="mainTitle">Feeding sources of organisms</h1>
<p>Organisms in an ecosystem are distinguished on the basis of their feeding sources. The source of all food is photosynthesis, through which plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) into organic compounds (e.g., sugars) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Plants use the energy stored in the organic compounds built during the process of photosynthesis. Since plants produce their food (i.e., organic compounds) themselves, they are called ‘producers’ or ‘autotrophs’. All animals are ‘heterotrophs’. Animals which eat plants are called ‘herbivores’ or ‘primary consumers’. Animals which feed on other animals are called ‘carnivores’ or ‘secondary consumers’. Each relationship which involves an herbivore (prey) and a carnivore (predator) is termed prey-predator relationship. Some carnivores predate on other carnivores. These predators are called ‘tertiary consumers’.</p>
