<h1 class="mainTitle">The mission's challenge</h1>
<p>Humans have an important effect on the balance in ecosystems; our behaviour sometimes causes pollution or the extinction of organisms.</p>
<p>Ecosystems consist of biotic and abiotic components â€“ all living organisms and their physical environment in a particular area. Different natural factors can cause changes in ecosystems, as well as the effects from the influence of humans. We can even see that in some cases, human influence depends on the type and characteristics of an ecosystem. Knowledge of the <b>relations in an ecosystem</b> can help preserve ecosystems for the future.</p>
<p>In this mission you will discover the relations between a number of ecological factors in a freshwater water body. You will discover how <b>nutrients</b> and <b>pH</b> have an effect on <b>populations</b>, how <b>light</b> intensity determines the level of <b>photosynthesis</b>, and how different <b>organisms</b> are related in an ecosystem through what they eat.</p>
<p>The <b>challenge</b> of this mission is to <b>find out the basic principles of ecosystems</b> so that in the future you will be able to use your up-to-date knowledge for identifying and solving problems with freshwater water bodies in your local area.</p>
