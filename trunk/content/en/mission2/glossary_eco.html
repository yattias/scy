    <h3 id="A">Abiotic factors</h3>
    Abiotic factors are sunlight, temperature, soil, water, height and pressure. Abiotic factors have intensified influence on forest ecosystem.
    <h3>Abundance</h3>The term ‘abundance’ refers to the number of individuals, by which a certain species is represented in an ecosystem.
    <h3>Aquatic food chain</h3>The food chain cannot have more than five steps. The food-chain starts from the producer (Green plants). The next 2nd step is herbivores. The 3rd step is made by omnivores. The 4th step is made by the carnivores. The 5th step is the bacterial level (decomposers). The dead bodies of plants and animals are decomposed into simple forms by the decomposers i.e. bacteria. These simple forms get mixed with the soil. In this way a food chain can have not more than five steps.
	<h3 id="B">Biomass</h3>Biomass is the total mass of living organisms in a specific ecosystem at a specific time. Biomass may be measured as the total, natural weight of the organisms themselves or as the dry organic weight (when all water has been extracted). Sometimes, the biomass of all organisms in an ecosystem is regarded, but one might also distinguish between the biomass present in different trophic levels (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, etc.).
	 <h3>Biotic factors</h3> The biotic factors include living organisms of ecosystems and their interrelationship. e.g. Symbiosis, mutualism, antagonism, parasitism, antibiosis, competition, predation and commencialism.
    <h3>Biotope</h3> A biotope is defined as an area with specific environmental conditions, which provides a living place for an assemblage of plant and animal species. The term ‘biotope’ is distinguished from the term ‘habitat’, in that the latter refers to a living place for a population of a certain species.  
	<h3>Buffering capacity</h3> Buffering capacity is an ability of water to resist changes in pH.
	<h3 id="C">Carbon dioxide</h3> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is used by autotroph organisms (i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) for photosynthesis. The carbon atoms then end up in all sorts of organic molecules (sugars, proteins, etc.). Conversely, heterotroph organisms (and at night, also autotroph organisms) produce CO<sub>2</sub> during respiration. In water, CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) to produce carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), that will (partially) dissolve into a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Thus, the pH of the water will decrease.
	<h3>Chemical equilibrium</h3> Chemical equilibrium is a state in the course of a reversible chemical reaction in which no net change in the amounts of reactants and products occurs. At equilibrium, the two opposing reactions go on at equal rates, or velocities, hence there is no net change in the amounts of substances involved. 
	<h3>Consumers</h3> A primary consumer is an animal that gets its energy from plants. It is also called an herbivore. A few examples of herbivores include cows, moose, gazelles, rabbits and elephants.
    <h3 id="D">Decomposers</h3> An organism, often a bacterium or fungus that feeds on and breaks down dead plant or animal matter, thus making organic nutrients available to the ecosystem.
	<h3 id="E">Ecological equilibrium</h3> This term refers to the idea that – in an ecosystem – there is a natural equilibrium (in terms of the species present and their relative abundance), that will be maintained in the absence of disturbance. In case of any deviation from this equilibrium, the ecosystem will automatically turn back into its original state. Recently, the idea of a more or less fixed ecological equilibrium has been challenged by scientists. Ecosystems are in reality much more versatile, with species appearing and disappearing all the time, and fluctuating in numbers. Even under controlled circumstances an ecosystem may behave chaotically.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid</h3> We can compare trophic levels by determining the number, biomass, or energy content of individuals at each level. This information can be depicted in the form of an ecological pyramid. The base of each pyramid corresponds to the producers and the subsequent trophic levels are added one on top of the other in their ‘feeding sequence’. Various types of pyramids can be used to describe different aspects of an ecosystem’s trophic structure.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of numbers</h3> Ecological pyramids of numbers present the size of each tier as proportional to the number of individuals present at each trophic level. In a typical pyramid of numbers, the number of individuals supported by the ecosystem at successive trophic levels declines progressively. This reflects the fact that the smaller biomass of top level consumers tends to be concentrated in a relatively small number of large animals.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of biomass</h3> Ecological pyramids of biomass represent the total dry weight of organisms at each trophic level. Dry weight is usually used as the measure of mass because the water content of organisms varies. Organism size is taken into account so meaningful comparisons of different trophic levels are possible. Biomass pyramids may be inverted in some systems (e.g. in some plankton communities) because the algal (producer) biomass at any one time is low, but the algae are reproducing rapidly and have a high productivity.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of energy</h3> Ecological pyramids of energy depict the size of each tier is proportional to the production (e.g. in kJ) of each trophic level. Pyramids of energy (or production) are often very similar in appearance to pyramids of biomass. The energy content at each trophic level is generally comparable to the biomass because similar amounts of dry biomass tend to have about the same energy content.
    <h3>Ecosystem</h3> An ecosystem is defined as the assemblage of all organisms living in a particular area (i.e., producers, consumers and decomposers), as well as all the abiotic components with which the organisms interact (e.g., soil, water, air, temperature, etc.). Biotic and abiotic components interact with each other through flow of energy and material. 
	<h3>Electrolytic dissociation</h3> Electrolytic dissociation is a phenomenon whereby ions in ionic compounds in an aqueous solution are freed from their mutual attractions and distribute themselves uniformly throughout the solvent.
	<h3>Energy transfer</h3> Interactions among producers and the organisms that consume and decompose them are called trophic interactions, and are composed of trophic levels in an energy pyramid, with most energy and mass in the primary producers at the base, and higher levels of feeding on top of this, starting with primary consumers feeding on primary producers, secondary consumers feeding on these, and so on. Trophic interactions are also described in more detailed form as afood chain, which organizes specific organisms by their trophic distance from primary producers, and by food webs, which detail the feeding interactions among all organisms in an ecosystem. Together, these processes of energy transfer and matter cycling are essential in determining ecosystem structure and function and in defining the types of interactions between organisms and their environment.
	<h3>Eutrophication</h3> A rise in the concentration of nutrients in an (aquatic) ecosystem, as a result of which the number of primary producers (mainly algae and cyanobacteria) considerably increases. An increase in nutrient levels in aquatic ecosystems is often the result of human agricultural or domestic (e.g. sanitary sewage) activity. The effects of eutrophication may be profound, extending to a severe drop in species diversity, a decrease in water transparency, and the occurrence of algal blooms (exuberant growth of a potentially toxic species of alga or cyanobacterium).
    <h3 id="F">Flow</h3> Flow can be defined as the amount of movement in a body of water. These movements can be horizontal, vertical or circulatory. As a result of flow – or mixing – abiotic conditions (temperature, the amount of nutrients) become more homogenous throughout the water body. A high level of flow also tends to increase the amount of turbidity, as small particles are swept up from the bottom.
    <h3 id="H">Hydrolysis</h3> Hydrolysis is a reverse process of neutralization reaction. In a hydrolysis reaction a salt reacts with water to yield the acid or base: BA + H<sub>2</sub>O  HA + BOH.
    <h3 id="L">Light</h3> Light is electromagnetic radiation, particularly radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye (about 400–700 nm, or perhaps 380–750 nm). The pigments that are responsible for capturing light for photosynthesis, absorb light with wavelengths ranging from 350 to 700 nm. In physics, the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. A light wave consists of energy in the form of electric and magnetic fields and because light has both electric and magnetic fields, it is also called electromagnetic radiation. Light, which exists in tiny &quot;packets&quot; called photons, exhibits properties of both waves and particles. This property is referred to as the wave–particle duality.
    <h3>Light intensity</h3> The strength of light; the amount of energy transmitted (as by acoustic or electromagnetic radiation). There are many kinds of light intensity, each with its own definition: (1) radiant intensity is electromagnetic power per unit solid angle. It is a measure of source intensity; (2) luminous intensity is wavelength-weighted based on a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye; (3) irradiance is electromagnetic power per unit area. It is a measure of received intensity; (4) Radiance is the amount of light that passes through a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle in a specified direction (i.e., the amount of light hitting 1 square meter and coming from 1 steradian).
    <h3 id="M">Matter</h3> Ecosystems include living organisms, the dead organic matter produced by them, the abiotic environment within which the organisms live and exchange elements (soils, water, atmosphere), and the interactions between these components.
    <h3>Molar concentration</h3> Molar concentration (molarity) is the concentration of a solution measured as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution [mole/L] and is denoted by M.
    <h3 id="N">Neutralization reaction</h3> Neutralization reaction is a reaction of an acid with a base which produces water and salt. It is a chemical reaction in which one compound acquires H<sup>+</sup> from another. The compound that receives the hydrogen ion is the base; the compound that surrenders it is an acid.
    <h3>Nutrients</h3> phosphate and nitrate: All substances that an organism needs in order to live and grow are called nutrients. In aquatic ecology, the term is often used to indicate the amount of phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in the system. Carbon dioxide and water may also be considered nutrients, but these are usually very abundant, while phosphate and nitrate are often limiting factors. Phosphate and nitrate are important components of the phosphorus cycle (P) and the nitrogen cycle (N) respectively. These cycles are complex, and comprise many different inorganic and organic molecules, in which either of these elements (or both) are present. An increase in nutrient levels in aquatic ecosystems is often the result of human (agricultural or domestic) activity (eutrophication).
    <h3 id="O">Oxygen</h3> Almost all organisms need oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) for cellular respiration. Heterotroph organisms (consumers and decomposers) rely solely on respiration for their energy. Autotroph organisms (primary producers, i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) only consume O<sub>2</sub> at night. During the day, autotroph organisms produce O<sub>2</sub> through the process of photosynthesis. Oxygen is one of the main components of air (approximately 20%). In aquatic ecosystems, organisms extract dissolved oxygen from the water.
    <h3 id="P">pH</h3> pH is a logarithmic measure of concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, pH = -log [H<sup>+</sup>]. pH is a measure of the acidity (or basicity) of a solution, where values of 0 to 14 are possible. Acid solutions have a pH &lt; 7, basic solutions have pH &gt; 7, neutral solutions have pH = 7.
    <h3>pH indicators</h3> pH indicators are substances that undergo a sharp, easily observable color change when pH of a solution changes. A solution’s pH can be conveniently measured using pH strips - pieces of paper impregnated with indicator or a mixture of indicators.
    <h3>Phytoplankton</h3> The term plankton refers to drifting organisms, predominantly microscopic in size, in aquatic ecosystems. A further distinction can be made between phytoplankton (autotroph plankton, such as algae) and zooplankton (microscopic animals, such as Daphnia). In many aquatic ecosystems, the main primary producers are phytoplankton.
    <h3>Photosynthesis</h3> The process a plant uses to combine sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sugar (energy).
    <h3>Population</h3> A population is defined as a group of organisms from the same species that interbreed, and live at the same place at the same time.
    <h3>Population size</h3> The population size of a population corresponds to the number of individuals of the species found in a certain place (e.g., number of individuals per unit of surface).
    <h3>Predators</h3> In a prey-predator relationship, the predator is the species which feed upon the prey.
    <h3>Prey</h3> In a prey-predator relationship, the prey is the species which the predator feeds on.
    <h3>Producers</h3> At a basic functional level, ecosystems generally contain primary producers capable of harvesting energy from the sun by photosynthesis and of using this energy to convert carbon dioxide and other inorganic chemicals into the organic building blocks of life.
    <h3 id="R">Range of tolerance</h3> Organisms can live within a range of (abiotic) conditions, called the range of tolerance. For instance, if we regard a temperature gradient, there will be two values – a minimum temperature and an maximum temperature – that set the upper and lower limits for a species’ survival. Below the minimum and above the maximum, organisms will experience too much physiological stress to survive. Somewhere in between the minimum and the maximum is the optimum range, where the temperature for this particular species is most favourable.
    <h3 id="S">Salinity</h3> The term salinity is used to indicate the salt content of a water body. Salinity not only refers to sodium chloride (salt used in the kitchen), but also incorporates other salts such as magnesium and calcium sulfate. Salinity can be measured in different ways. The Total Dissolved Salts (TDS), measured in mg/L, is most accurate. As an estimate of the TDS, the electrical conductivity (EC), measured in μS/cm, of the water can be measured (i.e. the more dissolved salt in the water, the higher the electrical conductivity). Fresh water usually has a TDS lower than 1.000 mg/L, and seawater a TDS higher than 10.000 mg/L.
    <h3>Salts</h3> Salts are compounds which result from a chemical reaction between acids and bases (neutralization reaction).
    <h3>Solubility</h3> Solubility of a substance is its concentration in a saturated solution. Substances with solubility much less than 1 g/100 mL of solvent are usually considered insoluble.
    <h3>Stable states</h3> The term stable states refers to the existence of two distinct, stable equilibria. This phenomenon was first demonstrated in shallow lakes. There is one state in which the water is relatively clear, and there are different species of fish and water plants and relatively few algae; and there is another state in which the water is turbid, and algae are very abundant, but few fish or water plants survive. Both system states are more or less stable and resilient. When abiotic conditions (predominantly the amount of nutrients in the system) change, the ecosystem might shift from one state to the other. Remarkably, the turning-point is dependent on the direction of the development. The level of nutrients at which a clear lake turns into a turbid one is higher than the level of nutrients that must be reached to turn the turbid lake back into its clear state. The existence of stable states has been identified in a number of other ecosystems.
    <h3 id="T">Temperature</h3> Temperature is an important concept in thermodynamics. Temperature may be defined as a measure of the average energy, or movement, of a large number of particles. Temperature can be measured with thermometers.
    <h3>Trophic levels</h3> Every ecosystem has a trophic structure: a hierarchy of feeding relationships which determines the pathways for energy flow and nutrient cycling. All species found in an ecosystem are assigned to trophic levels on the basis of their nutrition. Basic trophic levels include producers, consumers and decomposers.
