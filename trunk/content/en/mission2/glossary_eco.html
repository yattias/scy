    <h3 id="A">Abiotic factor</h3>
    Abiotic factors are sunlight, temperature, soil, water, depth in the water, elevation above sea level, and pressure. 
    <h3>Abundance</h3>The term ‘abundance’ refers to the number of individuals, by which a certain species is represented in an ecosystem.
    <h3>Aquatic food chain</h3>An aquatic food chain is a sequence of organisms eating each other in an aquatic ecosystem. The food chain does not normally have more than five steps. The food chain starts from the producer (green plants or algae). The 2nd node is herbivores (e.g. snails, some fish). The 3rd node is made up of omnivores (e.g. predator fish). The 4th node is made up of the carnivores. The 5th node is the bacterial level (decomposers). The dead bodies of plants, animals, and other organisms are decomposed into simple forms by the decomposers i.e., bacteria. These simple forms get mixed with the soil. In this way a food chain can have no more than five general steps (although sometimes there are several nodes of carnivores or decomposers).
	<h3 id="B">Biomass</h3>Biomass is the total mass of living organisms in a specific ecosystem at a specific time. Biomass may be measured as the total natural weight of the organisms themselves or as the dry organic weight (when all water has been extracted). Sometimes the biomass of all organisms in an ecosystem is considered, but one can also distinguish between the biomass present in different trophic levels (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, etc.).
	<h3>Biotic factor</h3>Biotic factors are all the living organisms in an ecosystem and their interrelations, (e.g., symbiosis, mutualism, antagonism, parasitism, antibiosis, competition, predation, and commensalism).
    <h3>Biotope</h3>A biotope is defined as an area with specific environmental conditions that provide a place for a community of plant and animal species to live. The term ‘biotope’ is different from the term ‘habitat’, which refers to a place where a population of a certain species lives. 
	<h3>Buffering capacity</h3>Buffering capacity is the ability of water to resist changes in pH.
	<h3 id="C">Carbon dioxide</h3>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is used by autotroph organisms (i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) for photosynthesis. In this way the carbon atoms then end up in all sorts of organic molecules (sugars, proteins, etc.). Conversely, heterotrophic organisms (and at night, also autotrophic organisms) produce CO<sub>2</sub> during respiration. In water, CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) to produce carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), that will (partially) dissolve into a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Thus, the pH of the water will decrease.
	<h3>Chemical equilibrium</h3>Chemical equilibrium is a state occurring in the course of a reversible chemical reaction, in which no net change in the amounts of reactants and products takes place. At equilibrium, the two opposing reactions go on at equal rates, or velocities; hence, there is no net change in the amounts of substances involved.
	<h3>Consumers</h3>A consumer is an organism that gets its energy directly from eating other organisms. It is also called an herbivore. A few examples of herbivores include cows, moose, gazelles, rabbits and elephants.
    <h3 id="D">Decomposers</h3> A decomposer is an organism, often a bacterium or fungus that feeds on and breaks down dead plant or animal matter, thus making organic nutrients available to the ecosystem.
	<h3 id="E">Ecological equilibrium</h3>This term refers to the idea that there is a natural equilibrium in an ecosystem (in terms of the species present and their relative abundance) that will be maintained in the absence of disturbance. Following any deviation from this equilibrium, the ecosystem will automatically return to its original state. Recently, the idea of a more or less fixed ecological equilibrium has been challenged by scientists. Ecosystems are actually much more versatile, with species appearing and disappearing all the time, and fluctuating in their abundance.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid</h3> We can compare trophic levels in an ecosystem by determining the number, biomass, or energy content of individuals at each level. This information can be depicted in the form of an ecological pyramid. The base of each pyramid corresponds to the producers, and the subsequent trophic levels are added in tiers, one on top of the other according to their ‘feeding sequence’. Various types of pyramids can be used to describe different aspects of an ecosystem’s trophic structure.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of numbers</h3>An ecological pyramid of numbers shows the size of each tier as proportional to the number of individuals present at each trophic level. In a typical pyramid of numbers, the number of individuals supported by the ecosystem at successive trophic levels declines progressively. This reflects the fact that the smaller biomass of top-level consumers tends to be concentrated in a relatively small number of large animals.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of biomass</h3>An ecological pyramid of biomass shows the size of each tier as proportional to the total dry weight of organisms at each trophic level. Dry weight is usually used as the measure of mass because the water content of organisms varies. Organisms' sizes are taken into account in order to make meaningful comparisons of different trophic levels. Biomass pyramids may be inverted in some systems (e.g., in some plankton communities), because the amount of algal (producer) biomass at any time is low, but the algae are reproducing rapidly and have high productivity.
	<h3>Ecological pyramid of energy</h3>An ecological pyramid of energy depicts the size of each tier as proportional to the energy production (e.g., in kJ) of each trophic level. Pyramids of energy (or production) are often very similar in appearance to pyramids of biomass. The energy content at each trophic level is generally comparable to the biomass because similar amounts of dry biomass tend to have about the same energy content.
    <h3>Ecosystem</h3>An ecosystem is defined as the community of all organisms living in a particular area (i.e., producers, consumers, and decomposers), as well as all of the abiotic components with which the organisms interact (e.g., soil, water, air, temperature). Biotic and abiotic components interact with each other through the flow of energy and material.
	<h3>Electrolytic dissociation</h3>Electrolytic dissociation is a phenomenon by which ions in ionic compounds in an aqueous solution are freed from their mutual attractions and distribute themselves uniformly throughout the solvent.
	<h3>Energy transfer</h3>Energy transfer occurs between trophic levels in an energy pyramid. In an energy pyramid, most energy and mass is in the primary producers at the base, and higher levels of feeding are on top of this, starting with primary consumers feeding on primary producers, secondary consumers feeding on these, and so on. Such interactions among producers and the organisms that consume and decompose them are called trophic interactions. Trophic interactions are also described in a more detailed form as a food chain, which organizes specific organisms by their trophic distance from primary producers, and by food webs, which detail the feeding interactions among all organisms in an ecosystem. Together, these processes of energy transfer and matter cycling are essential in determining ecosystem structure and function and in defining the types of interactions between organisms and their environment.
	<h3>Eutrophication</h3>A rise in the concentration of nutrients in an (aquatic) ecosystem, which causes the number of primary producers (mainly algae and cyanobacteria) to increase considerably. An increase in nutrient levels in aquatic ecosystems is often the result of human agricultural or domestic (e.g., sanitary sewage) activity. The effects of eutrophication may be profound, extending to a severe drop in species diversity, a decrease in water transparency, and the occurrence of algal blooms (exuberant growth of a potentially toxic species of algae or cyanobacteria).
    <h3 id="F">Water flow</h3>Water flow can be defined as the amount of movement in a body of water. This movement can be horizontal, vertical or circulatory. As a result of flow or mixing, abiotic conditions (temperature, the amount of nutrients, etc.) become more homogenous throughout the water body. A high level of flow also tends to increase the amount of turbidity, as small particles of soil are swept up from the bottom.
    <h3 id="H">Hydrolysis</h3> Hydrolysis is a reaction that reverses the process of neutralization. In a hydrolysis reaction, a salt reacts with water to yield the acid or base: BA + H<sub>2</sub>O -> HA + BOH.
    <h3 id="L">Light</h3> A light wave consists of energy in the form of electric and magnetic fields. Because light has both electric and magnetic fields, it is also called electromagnetic radiation. We use the term light particularly for radiation at a wavelength that is visible to the human eye (about 400–700 nm, or perhaps 380–750 nm), but in physics, the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.. The pigments that are responsible for capturing light for photosynthesis absorb light with wavelengths ranging from 350 to 700 nm. Light, which exists in tiny ‘packets’ called photons, exhibits properties of both waves and particles. This property is referred to as the wave–particle duality.
    <h3>Light intensity</h3>Light intensity is the strength of light; the amount of energy transmitted (by electromagnetic radiation). There are many kinds of light intensity, each with its own definition: (1) radiant intensity is electromagnetic power per unit solid angle (a measure of source intensity); (2) luminous intensity is wavelength (weighted based on a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye); (3) irradiance is electromagnetic power per unit area (a measure of received intensity); (4) radiance is the amount of light that passes through a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle in a specified direction (i.e., the amount of light hitting 1 square meter and coming from 1 steradian).
    <h3>Molar concentration</h3> Molar concentration (molarity) is the concentration of a solution measured as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution [mole/L] and is denoted by M.
    <h3 id="N">Neutralization reaction</h3> Neutralization reaction is a reaction of an acid with a base, which produces water and salt. It is a chemical reaction in which one compound acquires H<sup>+</sup> from another. The compound that receives the hydrogen ion is the base; the compound that surrenders it is an acid.
    <h3>Nutrient</h3>All substances that an organism needs in order to live and grow are called nutrients. For water plants, these are most often phosphate and nitrate. In aquatic ecology, the term is often used to indicate the amount of phosphate (PO43-) and nitrate (NO3-) in the system. Carbon dioxide and water may also be considered nutrients, but these are usually very abundant, while phosphate and nitrate are often limiting factors. Phosphate and nitrate are important components of the phosphorus cycle (P) and the nitrogen cycle (N), respectively.. An increase in nutrient levels in aquatic ecosystems (eutrophication) is often the result of human (agricultural or domestic) activity.
    <h3 id="O">Oxygen</h3>Almost all organisms need oxygen (O2) for cellular respiration. Heterotrophic organisms (consumers and decomposers) rely solely on cellular respiration for their energy. Autotrophic organisms (primary producers, i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) consume O2 only at night. During the day, autotrophic organisms produce O2 through the process of photosynthesis. Oxygen is one of the main components of air (approximately 21%). In aquatic ecosystems, organisms extract dissolved oxygen from the water.
    <h3 id="P">pH</h3> pH is a logarithmic measure of concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution; pH = -log (H<sup>+</sup>). pH is a measure of the acidity (or basicity) of a solution, where values of 0 to 14 are possible. Acid solutions have a pH &lt; 7, basic solutions have pH &gt; 7, neutral solutions have pH = 7.
    <h3>pH indicator</h3> pH indicators are substances that undergo a sharp, easily observable color change when pH of a solution changes. A solution’s pH can be conveniently measured using pH strips - pieces of paper impregnated with pH indicator or a mixture of indicators.
    <h3>Phytoplankton</h3> The term plankton refers to drifting organisms, predominantly microscopic in size, in aquatic ecosystems. A further distinction can be made between phytoplankton (autotroph plankton, such as algae) and zooplankton (microscopic animals, such as Daphnia). Phytoplanton are the main primary producers in many aquatic ecosystems.
    <h3>Photosynthesis</h3> Photosyntesis is the process a plant uses to combine sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sugar (energy).
    <h3>Population</h3> A population is defined as a group of organisms from the same species that interbreed and live at the same place at the same time.
    <h3>Population size</h3> The population size of a population corresponds to the number of individuals of the species found in a certain place (e.g., number of individuals per unit of surface).
    <h3>Predators</h3> In a prey-predator relationship, the predator is the species which feeds upon the prey.
    <h3>Prey</h3> In a prey-predator relationship, the prey is the species which the predator feeds.
    <h3>Producer</h3>Ecosystems generally contain primary producers (plants, algae, some bacteria), which are capable of harvesting energy from the sun by photosynthesis and of using this energy to convert carbon dioxide and other inorganic chemicals into the organic building blocks of life.
    <h3 id="R">Range of tolerance</h3>Organisms can live within a range of (abiotic) conditions, called the range of tolerance. For instance, if we consider a temperature gradient, there will be two values – a minimum temperature and a maximum temperature – that set the upper and lower limits for the survival of a species. Below the minimum and above the maximum, those organisms will experience too much physiological stress to survive. The optimum range is somewhere between the minimum and the maximum, where the temperature is most favourable for this particular species.
    <h3 id="S">Salinity</h3>The term salinity is used to indicate the salt content of a water body. Salinity not only refers to sodium chloride (salt used in the kitchen), but also includes other salts such as magnesium and calcium sulphate. Salinity can be measured in different ways. The Total Dissolved Salts measure (TDS), measured in mg/L, is the most accurate. The electrical conductivity (EC) of the water, measured in μS/cm, can be used as an estimate of the TDS (i.e., the more dissolved salt in the water, the higher the electrical conductivity). Fresh water usually has a TDS lower than 1.000 mg/L, and seawater has a TDS higher than 10.000 mg/L.
    <h3>Salts</h3> Salts are compounds that result from a chemical reaction between acids and bases (neutralization reaction).
    <h3>Solubility</h3> Solubility of a substance is its concentration in a saturated solution. Substances with solubility much less than 1 g/100 mL of solvent are usually considered insoluble.
    <h3>Stable states</h3>The term stable state refers to the existence of two distinct, stable equilibriums for an ecosystem. This phenomenon was first demonstrated in shallow lakes. There is one state in which the water is relatively clear, with different species of fish and water plants and relatively few algae; and there is another state in which the water is turbid and algae are very abundant, but few fish or water plants survive. Both system states are more or less stable and resilient. When abiotic conditions (predominantly the amount of nutrients in the system) change, the ecosystem might shift from one state to the other. Remarkably, the turning-point depends on the direction of the change. The level of nutrients at which a clear lake turns into a turbid one is higher than the level of nutrients that must be reached to return the turbid lake back to its clear state. The existence of stable states has been identified in a number of other ecosystems.
    <h3 id="T">Temperature</h3> Temperature is an important concept in thermodynamics. Temperature may be defined as a measure of the average energy, or movement, of a large number of particles particles of matter. Temperature can be measured with thermometers.
    <h3>Trophic levels</h3> Every ecosystem has a trophic structure: a hierarchy of feeding relationships which determines the pathways for energy flow and nutrient cycling. All species found in an ecosystem are assigned to trophic levels on the basis of how they obtain their nutrition. Basic trophic levels include producers, consumers and decomposers.
