<p>Use PowerPoint to prepare your presentation. You may use any file or document that you have made so far. So, include small texts, images, figures, graphs, concept-maps, data from the simulation, or any other item that you think is relevant. Similar to the design assignment itself, the following elements should be incorporated in the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>a presentation of the house</li>
<li>relevant knowledge from the four expert groups</li>
<li>choice of energy input</li>
<li>an argumentation for the shape of the house</li>
<li>energy loss</li>
<li>choice of building material and insulation</li>
<li>House drawings</li>
<li>House choices </li>
<li>House data</li>
<li>cost and realism of your CO-2 friendly house</li>
</ul>
<p>While preparing your presentation, make sure you have an overview of all the choices your design group has made. During the presentation, you may have to support these decisions by brief argumentations. Since the others may not an expert in the field of CO2-friendly building, you may also have to explain the technical terms that you use.</p>
