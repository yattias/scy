<p>Design a CO-2 friendly house for a family of four (two parents and two children). The house should be as CO-2 friendly as possible, but at the same time provide enough room and a reasonable level of comfort for its users. Your challenge is to balance both requirements in your design. </p>
<p>Your design group has to produce a collection of drawings that include:
<ul>
<li>drawings of the exterior of the house (front view, side view and top view),</li>
<li>floor plans of the interior of the house,</li>
<li>a 3D artist’s impression.</li>
</ul>
All drawings, except for the artist’s impression, must specify dimensions (e.g. size of walls, windows, etc.).
</p>
<p>Your house drawings can be produced in different ways:
<ul>
<li>using Google SketchUp (see the 'Resources' drawer),</li>
<li>using other (technical) drawing software,</li>
<li>using pencil and paper (and a ruler, to make sure that dimensions are accurate).</li>
</ul>
