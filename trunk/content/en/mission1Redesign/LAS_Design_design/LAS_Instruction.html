<h1>Decide upon the characteristics of your CO-2 friendly house</h1>
<p>At the beginning of the mission you have been engaged in a brainstorm session with your design group, to note down your "First ideas". Now it is time to select the measures you will take to make your house as CO-2 friendly as possible. This selection process follows a two-step approach. You first make an <b>inventory of expert solutions</b>. This is an overview of all ideas that were agreed upon in the exprt groups. The next step is to scale down the number of solutions in your design. This is where you have to make <b>choices</b> about the design of your house. </p>
