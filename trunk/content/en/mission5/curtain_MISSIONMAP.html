<p>Welcome to <em>Run For Your Life</em>! </p>
<p>During this mission you are going to study the effects of energy drinks. Energy drinks claim to make you more alert or give you a boost of energy to keep on going. The effects of these drinks are incredible if you have to believe the commercials (e.g. watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNgbAwReV6M" target="_external">this</a> video). 
But do energy drinks really give you more energy? In this mission you are going to act as a researcher and try to answer this question. </p>
<p>Also, you will  explore the virtual environment - SCY-Lab - that is behind the mission. You will learn how to navigate through the various parts of the mission, and how to create and handle your own files and documents.</p>
<p align="left">Have fun.</p>
