<p> It is time to test your hypothesis. Of course we could do this in real experiments, but we can also do this with a model. 
In this part of the mission you will work with a model that simulates the effects of glucose intake on the blood glucose level with or without exercise. 
After doing the experiment with the model, you will analyse the results and formulate an answer to your research question. </p>


<p><strong>Learning goals</strong><br/>
In this part of the mission you will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>about the effects of intake of glucose on the concentration of glucose in the blood</li>
