<p> Now it is time to test your hypothesis. Performing a real experiment would involve a lot of test subjects and would take a lot of time. Instead you will test your hypothesis with a virtual model. 
This model simulates the effects of glucose intake on the blood glucose concentration (with or without exercise). 
After doing your experiment  you will analyse the results and formulate an answer to your research question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning goals</strong></p>
<p> In this part of the mission you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>about the effects of intake of glucose on the concentration of glucose in the blood</li>
<li>about the difference of the concentration of  glucose in your blood with or without exercise</li>
</ul>
