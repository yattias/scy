<p><strong>02: Hypothesis</strong> <br /></p>
<p>Consider the following four situations and predict what will happen with the blood glucose contentration (remove the words that do not apply):</p>
<ol>
  <li>At time 0 you drink an energy drink containing glucose. After that you sit down  for 60 minutes.</li>
  <li>At time 0 you drink an energy drink containing glucose. After 30 minutes you start running on a treadmill for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>At time 0 you drink a glass of water. After 30 minutes you start running on a treadmill for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>At time 0 you drink a glass of water. After that you sit down and don't move for 60 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now read the following research question carefully:</p>
<p><i>Is it useful to drink an energy drink before you are going to exercise?</i> </p>
<p>Perhaps you already have expectations about the answer to this research question. This expectation is your hypothesis.  Formulate your own hypothesis by finishing the last sentence.</p>
