<p><strong>05: Report</strong> <br /></p>
<p>

Research doesn't stop when you have drawn your conclusions. Scientists share their findings with their colleagues (and the general public) by writing papers and reports. Write a short report on the experiments that you have performed. This report must have the following chapters:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>introduction</em><br />  
    Explain the particular situation or the problem that was the starting point of your research. Provide some general background information when necessary.</li>
  <li><em>research questions and hypotheses</em><br />
    Cleary state your research questions and hypotheses.    </li>
  <li><em>experimental procedure</em><br />
    Describe the simulations you have performed. You can show the computer model you have been working on.</li>
  <li><em> results of your experiment</em><br />
    Briefly discuss the results of your experiments. You can also incorporate the graphs and figures you have created.    </li>
  <li><em> conclusions</em><br />
  Briefly discuss the main conclusions of your investigations. Also make some references to the general problem that was mentioned in the introduction. </li>
</ol>
</p>

After you have finished your report, you have completed your first mission. Well done!
