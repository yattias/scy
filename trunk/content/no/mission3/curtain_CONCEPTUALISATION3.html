<p><strong>Spending energy:</strong>  In the previous part of the mission you have studied food pyramids.
The food pyramid is designed to show the optimal balance between different categories of food products. 
But you probably remember the staircase at the left side of the new food pyramid: a reference to your exercising behaviour. 
It is not only the composition of your  diet that matters, the quantity is also important. 
There has to be a balance  between the amount of calories in your food, and the amount of energy you spend.
And that depends on the activities you undertake throughout the day.
</p>
