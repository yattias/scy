<h2>What is the challenge?
</h2>
<p>Your job is to design a CO2-friendly house. So you have to think of all kinds of measures and applications, that will reduce the CO2-emissions of your house. But, although the reduction of CO2-emissions is the central issue, your house has to provide room and a reasonable level of comfort for a family of four members (two parents and two children).

At the end of this project, your have to present your CO2-friendly house to the rest of the group. Throughout this project, you have to complete a number of assignments. The Mission Map (at the bottom-right corner of your screen) will guide you through the project. You will be working on your house design in a small group of students (your design group).

Before you can actually start to design your house, you have to become an expert. Each member of a design group will be assigned a specific expert role. You are either (1) a thermal expert, (2) an energy expert, or (3) a domestic expert. Especially in the first half of the mission, you will collaborate with classmates with the same expert role. The main task of this expert group is to find information and to do real and virtual experiments. You will present your expert findings in a concept-map.

Good luck!
