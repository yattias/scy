<title>Inventory and choices of solutions</title>

<p>What will make  your house CO2-friendly?</p>
<p>Your goal is to design  a CO2-friendly house. The past few lessons you have been working in  expert groups to gain a lot of knowledge about all kinds of measurements that  might influence the ‘CO2-friendliness’ of a house. Each of you has  been working in a particular field of knowledge: thermal insulation, energy production,  or domestic issues. Now the time has come to get back with your design group,  and really start designing (i.e. drawing, describing, simulating) YOUR OWN  HOUSE.<br />
  Listen to the presentation of each expert and  make an inventory of all the possible CO2-friendly solutions and  adaptations that each of the three experts know of. Like in the brainstorm session  at the beginning of the mission, you will use the schematic drawing of a house  to make this inventory. Arrange all ideas around (and in) the drawing, connect  each item to one of the arrows and point out conflicting solutions (e.g. Choose big windows is a good solution for an expert and small ones are better for another expert).</p>
<p>Using the inventory of expert solutions, make  another brainstorm session, and try to make some first choices. For instance, discuss the shape, size and other  architectural features of your house. Make a first selection of all the  appliances that should be in it. Also, try to make a decision regarding the  energy source(s) for your house. You are by no means making any definitive  choices. At any point during the following lessons, you may come back to your  first choices and go for other options. Again, you will use the schematic drawing of  the house drawing to arrange your ideas.</p>
<p>Please note that the inventory of expert solutions  and the list of first choices are separate products. Save each product as a  separate document.</p>
<p>Final note<br />
At the end of the  mission, each of you has to write an individual report. In this report, you  will discuss the choices that your group has made to make your house CO2-friendly.  Therefore, it is a good idea to keep a record of the things that you discuss in  your group, and the decisions that were made. More information about the report  assignment can be found elsewhere.</p>
