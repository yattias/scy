<h1>Concept map on CO2-levels</h1>
<p>The goal of this mission is to design a CO2-friendly  house. But why do we want our house to be CO2-friendly? The purpose  of this assignment is to build a <strong>concept  map</strong> that explains the importance of reducing global CO2-levels.  Your concept map should also explain the most important processes of the carbon  cycle.</p>
<p>A concept map is a  graphical representation of important concepts (in boxes), and the relations  between those concepts (represented by arrows or lines with a label). This may  sound complicated, but if you take a look at the example on the following page,  it will become clear what the main idea of a concept map is.</p>
<h2>What do I have to do?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A beginning of the concept-map is already given.</li>
  <li>You have to add 10 other concepts at least.</li>
  <li>Each concept has to be connected with at least one  other concept with an arrow.</li>
  <li>Each connection  (relation) has to be defined. Useful labels are for instance ‘is’, ‘causes’,  ‘produces’ and ‘used for’.</li>
</ol>
