<p><a name="Part1" id="Part1"></a>Becoming an expert...</p>
<p>You are now a member of an expert group. The following  lessons your goal is to become an expert in a particular field of knowledge.  But how do you become an expert? How do you ‘build’ knowledge? Of course you  are familiar with search engines such as Google, which you use to find  information on the internet. But most of the knowledge you find on the internet  and in books, was originally produced by ‘people who did some kind of research  and wrote about it’. So, in addition to studying existing resources, we also  want you to carry out experiments yourself, and thus create ‘new knowledge’. Just  like real scientists do. </p>
<p>The steps that you will follow in the process of becoming  an expert are depicted in the diagram below. </p>
<p>As you can see, there  are multiple pathways through the diagram. Basically, there are two main  routes. One route runs in ‘theory space’, in which you may recognize the  process of studying existing resources described above. The other route flows  from ‘theory space’ to ‘experimental space’ and back. So if you do experiments,  you have to follow this route. Complicated as it may seem at first sight, once  you start working, you will find that each activity follows more or less  logically from the previous one. Each step will be explained in detail in this  document.</p>

<p>How to divide the work<br />
Following these steps, your expert group builds up a  lot of knowledge on certain aspects of CO2-friendly building. Later  on, each of you will be using this knowledge for the benefit of your own design  group. But for now you have to operate as a team. It might be wise to divide  tasks between the members of your expert group. But by the end of the expert  phase, all findings must have been shared, so that each member has acquired  more or less the same knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>What must be delivered<br />
  Scientists often share the outcome of their research  in a written report. Instead of writing a report, your expert group will  deliver two ‘products’ that more or less serve the same purpose as a report:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, you will present your findings in a  concept-map. This concept-map explains the relations between the concepts and  variables you have explored.</li>
  <li>Second, you will hold a short presentation about your  findings in your design group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where to start<br />
But first you have to  become an expert. It is often a good idea to start with doing some background  reading and study existing resources on your subject. After you have become acquainted  with the most important terms and concepts in your field of knowledge, it is time  to formulate a couple of research questions. If your question can be answered  experimentally, the next sequence of steps will guide you through the process  of designing and running experiments, and drawing conclusions from them. When  needed, ask your teacher for feedback.</p>
<p><a name="Part2" id="Part2"></a>1. Browse resources for information</p>
<p>You have been assigned a specific expert role: energy  expert, insulation expert or electricity expert. Now you have to do some  background reading, to find out what concepts and phenomena are important in  your particular field of knowledge. Maybe you already have a lot of experience  doing this kind of ‘research’. Nevertheless, the following guidelines might  help you to collect the right information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do not rely exclusively on one resource.<br />
    Wikipedia is often a good website to start with if a subject is new for you.  However, it is necessary to collect information from various other resources  (other websites, books, etc.) as well. The information you find on one  particular website is often incomplete, and might even be incorrect. Another  good source of information are people who are experts themselves. So you could  also consider doing an interview with someone to gather specific information.</li>
  <li>Assess the reliability of your resource.<br />
    Some resources (especially websites) do not provide accurate information.  Websites from universities, museums and organisations related to the government  are usually very reliable. Use your common sense to assess who the author of a  website is, and whether the information on the site can be ‘trusted’. </li>
  <li>Always keep your (research) questions in mind.<br />
  The amount of information available through the internet is almost unlimited.  If you don’t try to focus on your particular questions, it might be hard not to  ‘drown’ in all the facts and figures you find on the net. Of course you may add  new research questions along the way.</li>
  <li>Save the URL’s of all the websites you use.<br />
    It often happens that you copy some information from a particular website, and  – on a later moment – decide that you need additional information from the same  website. Therefore it is necessary to keep track of your ‘browsing history’.  Also, a complete list of all the resources you have used has to be a part of  the (individual) report that you have to deliver at the end of the mission.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Part3" id="Part3"></a>2. Critically examine and compare resources</p>
<p>Having found a number of resources with the  appropriate information, you need to collect and organize your findings in an  efficient way. It might help you to follow these guidelines: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Read.<br />
    First, you have to read the resources you have found carefully. Of course you  may skip sections that have no relation with any of your research questions.</li>
  <li>Summarize.<br />
  Then you have to summarize the information that you need. Instead of writing a  summary in regular text-format, you can also try to make a list of keywords or  ‘key-sentences’. Do NOT copy-paste entire paragraphs from existing texts.</li>
  <li>Organise data.<br />
    Sometimes it is wise to organise particular information in tables (e.g. lists  of appliances and their attributes, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Part4" id="Part4"></a>3. Ask research questions</p>
<p>Now that you are more  or less familiar with the most important concepts and factors in your expert  domain, it is time to construct a couple of research questions. A research  question precisely describes something that you want to find out. But what is a  ‘good’ research question? Formulating research questions can be quite difficult  if you have never done it before. Here are some guidelines that will help you: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a question that is not too broad and not too  narrow.</li>
  <li>A question has to be researchable (e.g. you have to be  able to collect the right data).</li>
  <li>‘Open’ questions are usually more useful than ‘closed’  questions.</li>
  <li>A useful phrase could be: ‘what is the influence of  [concept 1] on [concept 2]?’</li>
</ol>
<p>Start your expert  research by formulating three research questions (for the whole group).  Additional questions will be added later on.</p>
<p><a name="Part5" id="Part5"></a>4. Construct hypothesis</p>
<p>In the previous step, you have formulated a number of  research questions. Maybe you already have some ideas or expectations about the  answers to your questions. These ‘expectations’ are your hypotheses. The goal  of this step is to formulate a hypothesis for each research question.</p>
<p>What is a ‘good’ hypothesis? Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A hypothesis is a clear and concise statement which  expresses the expected answer to a question.</li>
  <li>A hypothesis has to be testable.</li>
  <li>A hypothesis does not have to be correct;<br />
    if your hypothesis turns out to be false, that doesn’t mean your research was  not successful.</li>
  <li>Many hypotheses are phrased as ‘if … , then …’  statements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have  formulated a couple of research questions and hypotheses, it is time to start  thinking about the practical work. If possible, try to involve doing real  experiments in the classroom or at home, or doing virtual experiments with the  house simulation tool. In some cases, it is not possible to carry out experiments  yourself (e.g. you cannot explore the efficiency of nuclear power plants in the  science lab of your school). Then you have to go back to <a href="#Part2">step 1</a> of the inquiry  cycle and turn to websites, books and other resources to answer your question.</p>
<p><a name="Part6" id="Part6"></a>5. Design experiments</p>
<p>Before you actually start performing your experiments,  you have to describe what you plan to do. In other words, you have to write an experimental procedure. An  experimental procedure is a detailed, step-by-step description of an experiment.  Even when you plan to execute the experiment yourself, your experimental  procedure has to be precise and clear. Another person should have enough  information to perform the experiment in the same way.</p>
<p>An experimental procedure is composed of an organized list of tasks that have to be  carried out. All instructions must specify the materials that have to be used, and all parameters that define the task that has to be done (e.g. the  quantities of substances, the input parameters of a device, etc.).</p>
<p>Example of a task (materials and parameters are  underlined): <br />
Measure <u>50 mL</u> of <u>solution S</u> with a <u>50  mL pipette.</u></p>
<p>Because the nature of the experiments that you are  going to perform, varies from group to group, and from question to question, it  is not possible to set specific rules for the design of your experiments. Nevertheless,  refer to the following checklist to evaluate your experimental procedure:</p>
<p>The experimental procedure is <em>precise and clear</em>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The list of tasks is complete. All parameters and       materials are specified. </li>
  <li>The list of tasks is  structured in such a way that it is easy to understand. Tasks could be organized in steps and sub-steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experimental procedure is <em>realistic</em>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The chosen materials are accessible. </li>
  <li>The experiment can be executed in the amount of       time available. </li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment is <em>safe</em>. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Potential hazards are evaluated. </li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment is <em>consistent  with your research questions and hypotheses</em>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The       variables described in the research question(s) correspond with the       parameters that will be changed during the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment is <em>consistent  with the scientific method</em>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Only       one variable will be changed at a time.</li>
  <li>Errors of measurement are  minimized, and sources of variance are controlled. The dispersion of the  different values must be as narrow as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Part7" id="Part7"></a>6. Run experiments</p>
<p>Now it is time to actually carry out your experiments.  If you have gone through all the preparatory work seriously, this will not be  too difficult. General guidelines are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>work seriously and accurately</li>
  <li>store all data carefully (these are your ‘raw’ data)</li>
  <li>take notes of any  deviations from your original experimental design</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Part8" id="Part8"></a>7. Process data</p>
<p>You have carried out your experiments, and collected your  data. If you have gathered a large collection of numerical data, it is often a  good idea to reorganize them in a structured and convenient way. You want to  present your data in such a way, that it  is easy to understand what measurements you have made and what the outcome of  your experiments is. Consider doing the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>calculate mean values (and maybe standard deviations)</li>
  <li>present the most relevant data in small tables</li>
  <li>plot data for independent and dependent variables in  diagrams</li>
  <li>use a simple statistical test to assess the validity  of your conclusions</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it is time to go  back to your research questions and hypotheses and see if you can draw any  conclusions from your data.</p>
<p><a name="Part9" id="Part9"></a>8. Draw conclusions</p>
<p>The outcome of your experiments must now be compared  with the hypotheses that were formulated. Looking at the data, try to draw  conclusions for each of your research questions. Each hypothesis can be either  correct or incorrect (or partially incorrect).</p>
<ol>
  <li>If your hypothesis turns out to be correct, you can  move on to other research questions. Sometimes, your data will also give rise  to new research questions.</li>
  <li>If your hypothesis turns out to be incorrect, this  doesn’t mean that your whole research was not successful. Knowing that your  hypothesis was false, is also ‘new knowledge’. Sometimes, it is even possible  to give an answer to your research question right away. In other cases, it is  necessary to construct a new hypothesis and to design and run new experiments.</li>
  <li>Another conclusion might be that your data are  insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. Then it might be a good idea  to change your experimental design and / or run more experiments.  </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to writing your conclusions down in  regular text, you must also use the knowledge you have gained to build, or  extend, your expert concept-map.</p>
