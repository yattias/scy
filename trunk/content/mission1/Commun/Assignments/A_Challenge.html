<h1 class="mainTitle">The challenge: design a CO2-friendly house</h1>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Introduction</span><br />
</h2>
<p>Global warming is considered one of the most pressing problems mankind is facing. Global warming is related to climate change through the greenhouse effect. There have been various international conventions, such as the Kyoto protocol, trying to set thresholds to the emissions of greenhouse gases, with CO2 being the most prominent one. A crucial question is what we could do at the local level to fight global warming. Recently, there has been a series of innovations that addressed decreasing CO2 emissions of households. There are many adjustments one could plan to decrease the carbon-footprint of one‘s household. Also, there is a new type of houses, called CO2-friendly houses, which produce much less CO2 compared to conventional houses.</p>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Context</span><br />
</h2>
<p>You work as a project engineer at BioEnergy in […]. BioEnergy is a design agency, specialized in sustainable development and green building. The mayor of your city in has asked Bioenergy to realize a study about feasible, CO2-friendly family housing. The purpose of this study is to stimulate building cooperatives to invest in CO2-friendly projects, and to give advice to potential inhabitants of your city, who would like to build new, CO2-friendly houses.
A well-known measure to reduce the carbon-footprint of a house is the use of solar cells. But there are many alternative ways to generate renewable energy and to use finite energy resources much more efficiently. Other factors that contribute to the total amount of CO2 emitted by a house are, for example, the number and type of electric appliances in the household, the use of (hot) water, and the extent to which the house is insulated.</p>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Mission</span><br />
</h2>
<p>Your job is to design a CO2-friendly house. Although the reduction of CO2-emissions is the central issue, your house has to provide room and a reasonable level of comfort for a family of four members (two parents and two children). Throughout this project, you have to complete a number of tasks. Detailed information about each task will be given later on. Roughly there are three categories of tasks:
<h3>Design group tasks</h3>
The main task of your design group is to design the house itself. At the end of the mission, you have to present your house to the rest of the class.
<h3>Expert group tasks</h3>
Each member of a design group has a specific expert role. You are either a thermal expert, an energy expert or a domestic expert. Especially in the first half of the mission, you will collaborate with classmates with the same expert role. The main task of this expert group is to find information and to do real and virtual experiments. You will present your expert findings in a concept-map.
<h3>Individual tasks</h3>
At the end of the mission, each of you has to deliver an individual report.</p>
