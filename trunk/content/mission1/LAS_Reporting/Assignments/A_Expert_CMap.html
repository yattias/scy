<p>Expert Concept Map</p>
<p>You are working to become an expert in a particular domain.  As a result of your research (both theoretic and experimental), you will  acquired a lot of knowledge about the main concepts and mechanisms in your domain.  In the second half of the mission, you must use this knowledge for the benefit  of your design group. The decisions that have to be made during the design  phase of the mission, largely depend on your expertise. </p>
<p>The idea of this assignment is to put the findings of  your expert work in a concept-map. A  concept-map is a graphical representation of important concepts (in boxes), and  the relations between those concepts (represented by labelled arrows). This may  sound complicated, but if you take a look at the example on the last page, it  will become clear what the main idea of a concept-map is.</p>
<p>The purpose of making a concept-map is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, you cannot produce a concept-map unless you <em>understand</em> the concepts in it really  well. Also, the process of making a concept-map forces you to be precise about  the relations between these concepts.</li>
  <li>Second, a concept-map is a useful instrument to <em>communicate</em> about your findings with  other people. You will use the concept-map to share your knowledge with the  rest of your expert group and, later, your design group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, people who read your expert concept-map  should be able to understand the main concepts. It should also be clear which  mechanisms are relevant for solving the mission, i.e. reducing the total amount  of CO2-emission of your house.</p>
<p>How do you start making your concept-map?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start by selecting a small number of concepts that are  important for your expert domain.</li>
  <li>Then, try to connect those concepts with each other.  An arrow connecting two concepts should also have a label, a word or a brief  phrase that defines the relationship between these concepts.</li>
  <li>Each concept or idea has to be connected with, at  least, 1 other concept.</li>
  <li>From that point on, your concept-map will grow. You  will probably think of new concepts that are related to the ones that are  already in the concept-map.</li>
  <li>Of course you can always  make changes to parts of your concept-map you have done earlier.</li>
</ol>
