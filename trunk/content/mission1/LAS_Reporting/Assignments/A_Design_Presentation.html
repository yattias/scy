<h1>Present your  house design</h1>
<p>At the end of the mission, you have to present the  final design of your CO2-friendly house to the other design groups. Pretend  that this is also the presentation for the mayor of your city, who ordered a  study on the design and feasibility of CO2-friendly houses.</p>
<p>Use the presentation tool to prepare your presentation. You may  use any file or document that you have made so far. So, include small texts, images,  figures, graphs, concept-maps, data from the simulation, or any other item that  you think is relevant. Similar to the design assignment itself, the following  elements should be incorporated in the presentation:</p>
<h3>A. House images<br />
</h3>
Show some 3D impressions and/or floor plans.<br />
<h3>B. House characteristics </h3>
Specify the various characteristics of your design  (e.g. total useable surface of the house, structure and insulation of walls and  other building elements, the energy supply, descriptions of the appliances in  the household).<br />
<h3>C. Analysis of house performance</h3>
Present the data from the simulation (e.g. the total  estimated CO2-emission of your house).<br />
<p>While preparing your presentation for the mayor, make  sure you have an overview of all the choices your design group has made. During  the presentation, you may have to support these decisions by brief argumentations.  Since the mayor is not an expert in the field of CO2-friendly building,  you may also have to explain any technical terms that you use.</p>
<h2>Some final guidelines:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The presentation itself should take no longer than 10  minutes.</li>
  <li>The presentation may be done by your whole design  group, or by one or two representatives.</li>
  <li>If you choose to hold the presentation with two or  more people, make sure that each speaker has a specific part of the  presentation for which he or she is responsible.</li>
  <li>When you are finished with the preparatory work, ask  your teacher for some final feedback.</li>
  <li>Practice your  presentation a few times in your design group.</li>
</ol>
