<h2>Generate research questions
</h2>
<p>Now that you are more or less familiar with the most important concepts and factors in your field of expertise, it is time to construct a couple of research questions. A research question precisely describes something that you want to find out. But what is a 'good' research question? Formulating research questions can be quite difficult if you have never done it before. Here are some guidelines that may help you:</p>
<p>- Choose a question that is not too broad and not too narrow.<br />
- A question has to be researchable (i.e., you have to be able to collect the right data).<br />
- 'Open' questions (questions starting with words like "What", "How" or "When") are usually more useful than 'closed' questions that can be answered by a simple "Yes" or "No".<br />
- A useful phrase could be: "what is the influence of [concept 1] on [concept 2]?"</p>
<p>Start your research by formulating three research questions. Additional questions can be added later on.
