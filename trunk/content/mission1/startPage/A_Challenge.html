<p>Canteen Cuisine addresses the need of healthy meals at school canteens/cafeterias around the world. Today, children in Europe and the United States consume more food products high in sugar, salt and fat content than thirty years ago. This led to the increase of many health problems including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart related disease and other diet-related problems. Thus, the purpose of the Canteen Cuisine mission is to actively engage you in practices related to the canteen/cafeteria cuisine of your school. You will be involved in creating a healthy pizza for your school canteen/cafeteria while taking into consideration the nutritional value of the ingredients, the human digestive system, diet-related health issues and daily exercise.</p>
 <p class="Bold">In this project, your job is to design a healthy pizza.</p>
