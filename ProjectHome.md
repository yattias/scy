**SCY** aims to take science education to the next level by developing a flexible, open-ended learning environment that truly engages and empowers adolescent learners. Within this learning environment, called **SCY-Lab**, students embark on authentic missions that can be completed through constructive and productive learning activities. SCY-Lab provides adaptive support for these activities through cutting-edge technologies as well as pedagogical scaffolds that go well beyond the state of the art.

In SCY learners work on a mission, a project in which learners have to produce something, such as an artifact, a design or an advice. Examples of missions are: "Design a house that is CO2 -neutral", or: "Make a feeding program for cows, in order to make them produce healthier milk". Missions are always multifaceted and require learners to search for information, do some research, discuss and collaborate with others, etc. SCY's main principle is that in these activites, learners always produce artefacts. These artefacts, called Emerging Learning Objects (or ELOs), can range from small notes, reports of measurements, to computer models of the situations, drawings, designs and reports. These ELOs form the basis for organizing the work, to monitor progress and to collaborate with others. SCY-Lab is the main place where learners will see, create, edit and share their ELOs.
