<i>Step 5: Formulate interview question</i><br>
Now think of a question you could ask someone to gather information about the __INDICATOR__. This is the question you will actually be using in the interview. 
<p>
Good interview questions: 
<ul>

<li>are consistent with the answer options
<li>are clearly stated, allowing for only one interpretation
<li>are positively stated (do not use negations)
<li>are not suggestive
</ul>

Poor: “How often do you take a shower and bath?”<br>
Good: “How often do you take a shower?”

Poor: “How often do you go to the bathroom”<br>
Good: “How often do you go to the toilet”
