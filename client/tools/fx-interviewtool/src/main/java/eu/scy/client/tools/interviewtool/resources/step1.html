<i>Step 1: Formulate research question</i><br>
Everything you do in preparing an interview is guided by your research question. As a first step, you should therefore write down your research question below. This should be a short phrase stating what you want to know about a given topic. The research question thus reflects your information needs or, worded differently, the reason why you decided to do the interview.
<p>
A sound research question should:
<ul>
<li>address only 1 topic
<li>be directly related to your SCY mission
<li>be clearly stated, allowing for only one interpretation
<li>be well-delineated such that it can be answered within the time available
<li>not be answered before (i.e., the information the interview aims to retrieve cannot be obtained elsewhere)
</ul>
Here are some examples of research questions that meet these requirements:
<ul>
<li>What is the average amount of water used by Amsterdam households?
<li>How did Al Gore’s movie “An inconvenient truth” change people’s view on global warming?
<li>Why do German truckers object against the use of bio fuel?
</ul>
