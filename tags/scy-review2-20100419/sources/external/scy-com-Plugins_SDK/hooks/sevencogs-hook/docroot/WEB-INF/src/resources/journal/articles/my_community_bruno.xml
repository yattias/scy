I have 2 <strong>public pages</strong>: Profile and Blog. Everybody can see these pages by going to <a href="/web/bruno">@portal_url@/web/bruno</a> but only I can modify the content in them. I can create more public pages (Add page) and add more applications to those pages in the dock menu (Add Aplication).</p> <p>I also have some <strong>private pages</strong> that only I can see (my socialSpace, my workSpace and my email).
