<h2>How to start?
</h2>
<p>1. Start by creating a few concepts that are important for domestic CO2 emission.<br/>
2. Connect these concepts with each other. A link connecting two concepts should have a label: a word or a brief phrase that defines the relationship between these concepts.<br/>
3. Each concept or idea has to be connected with at least one other concept.<br/>
4. From that point on, your concept map will grow. You will probably think of new concepts that are related to the ones that are already in the concept map.<br/>
5. Of course you can always make changes to parts of your concept map you have done earlier.
