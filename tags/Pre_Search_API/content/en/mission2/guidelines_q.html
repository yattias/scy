<h2>Guidelines: Research questions</h2>
<ul><li>Choose a question that is not too broad and not too narrow.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A question has to be researchable (e.g. you have to be able to collect the right data) and feasible using available resources (time, equipment, etc.).</li></ul>
<ul><li>A good research question contains one independent factor and one dependent factor.</li></ul>
<ul><li>&quot;Open&quot; questions are usually more useful than ‘closed’ questions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A useful phrase could be: &quot;what is the relation between [concept 1] and [concept 2]?&quot;</li></ul>
<p>At this stage, formulate at least two research questions. Additional research question can be formulated later on.</p>
