<h1>Guidelines: Hypothesis</h1>
  <ul>
	<li>A hypothesis is a clear and concise statement which expresses the expected answer to a question.</li>
	<li>A hypothesis has to be testable.</li>
    <li>A hypothesis does not have to be correct: if your hypothesis turns out to be false, that doesn&acute;t mean your research was not successful.</li>
    <li>Many hypotheses are phrased as &lsquo;if … , then … &rsquo; statements.</li>
  </ul>
