<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Here you are provided with an experimental procedure developed by experts. You can use it in your experiment for getting valid results.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Weigh 20 mg of Canadian Waterweed.</li>
  <li>Set up the Halogen lamp.</li>
  <li>Fill the 750 ml transparent beaker slowly with water.</li>
  <li>Measure the light intensity right next to the beaker with the Light Sensor.</li>
  <li>Make sure the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is constant (below 2 mg/l) at the beginning of each experiment.</li>
  <li>Place the plants in to the 750 ml beaker filled with water.</li>
  <li>Place Dissolved Oxygen Probe in water. Stir gently until the reading stabilizes. Take readings of oxygen concentration in each 5 minute during 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Take off the plants and empty the baker and fill it again slowly with water again.</li>
  <li>Change the light intensity by placing the beaker in different distances from the light source. Measure the light intensity next to beaker.</li>
  <li>Place the plants back into the water in the beaker and take readings of oxygen concentration in each 5 minute during 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>When all readings have been taken, print out a graph to see the production of oxygen by plants in different light intensities.</li>
