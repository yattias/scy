<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Take a sample of a ground and wash it in tap water to remove dust and dirt.</li>
  <li>Rinse sample with distilled water.</li>
  <li>Weigh 5g of each ground to the vessels and add 50ml of distilled water to each of them.</li>
  <li>Stir the mixtures about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Leave the samples on a table for 5 minutes before measuring pH.</li>
  <li>Measure the pH of samples with Vernier pH sensor.</li>
  <li>Add sulfuric acid to each sample (according to the table below) and stir the mixtures.</li>
  <li>Measure the pH of samples with Vernier pH sensor.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Important notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Please test your Vernier pH sensor with standardized buffer solution before starting to measure.</li>
  <li>Please be patient, sometimes it takes some minutes until pH reading will stabilize.</li>
  <li>Please gently stir Vernier pH sensor in distilled water and dry with a paper towel before each measuring.</li>
</ul>
