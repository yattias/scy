<h1 class="mainTitle">Phytoplankton and primary production</h1>
<p>In ecosystems, a distinction is made between producers, consumers and reducers. All organisms that harvest energy from the sun and are able to build their own organic molecules, such as glucose, are called producers. All plants (and certain bacteria) are producers. Consumers (and reducers) get their energy from eating other organisms. All animals are consumers. Primary production is the process by which producers build new organic molecules from inorganic substances, usually through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In aquatic ecosystems, a further distinction can be made between macrophytes (larger water plants) and phytoplankton. The term plankton refers to drifting organisms, predominantly microscopic in size, in aquatic ecosystems. Some species of plankton are producers (phytoplankton, such as algae), other species belong to the group of the consumers (zooplankton, such as <i>Daphnia</i>). In many aquatic ecosystems, the main primary producers are phytoplankton.</p>
<p>How do you measure primary production? As explained above, primary production usually involves photosynthesis and an increase in the amount of organic molecules. Therefore, the total weight of the producers themselves is a good measure of the rate of primary production in an ecosystem. The term biomass is usually used for this purpose. Biomass is defined as the total mass of living organisms in a specific ecosystem at a specific time. Biomass may be measured as the total, natural weight of the organisms themselves or as the dry organic weight (when all water has been extracted). Sometimes, the biomass of all organisms in an ecosystem is regarded, but in the context of our mission we will focus on the weight of the producers only.</p>
