<h1 class="mainTitle">Challenge of the mission</h1>
<p>Ecosystems consist of biotic and abiotic components â€“ all living organisms and their physical environment in a particular area. Humans have an important effect on the balance in ecosystems but different natural factors cause changes as well. We can even see that in some cases the influence of anthropogenic (i.e. human) factors depend on the type and characteristics of an ecosystem. Therefore, everyone should be aware about the relations in an ecosystem in order to save it for our future.</p>
<p>In this mission you will discover the relations between a number of ecological factors in a freshwater water body. You will be able to discover how nutrients and pH have an effect on populations, how light intensity determines the level of photosynthesis, and which relations exist between different organisms in an ecosystem. The challenge of this mission is to find out the basic principles of ecosystems so that in the future you will be able to use your up-to-date knowledge for analysing and solving problems of water bodies in your local area.</p>
<p>During this mission you have to develop a concept map and a video report. The concept map indicates your knowledge about the topic before you start working on the mission and the video report illustrates your inquiry work. Inquiry consists from formulating research questions and hypotheses, planning experiments, conducting them, analysing collected results, and making inferences.</p>

<p>Firstly you have to make your initial concept map (click in the misson map on the <b>Concept map</b> icon).</p>
<p>Secondly look through the task for making video report and decide when to complete it (click in the misson map on the <b>Video report</b> icon).</p>
<p>After that you should select first inquiry cycle (click in the misson map on the <b>Orientation</b> icon).</p>   
<p class="Bold">Good luck to you on this adventure!</p>
