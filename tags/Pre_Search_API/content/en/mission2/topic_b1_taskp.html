<h1>Fomulating problem</h1>
<p>Otto and Sylvia are in front of a paradox situation: they observed that pikes (predator species) might outnumber roaches (prey species). Your task is to help Otto and Sylvia explain their observation. First, you can do some <a href="topic_b1_backinf_1.html">reading</a> on the most important topics of the background theory concerning relationships between trophic levels in an ecosystem, characteristics of aquatic ecosystems, and prey-predator interactions. Then, you can browse a series of <a href="topic_b1_back.html">websites</a>, which illustrate relationships between trophic levels, aquatic ecosystems, and prey-predator interactions. While doing the background reading and browsing the web pages, your task is to focus on the parameters involved in prey-predator interactions (namely, population sizes of the prey and predator populations, and population trends of prey and predator populations in time). After you become familiar with the most important aspects of these phenomena, you will try to formulate the main problem you will address.</p>
<p>Note that the formulation of the problem (i.e., Otto’s and Sylvia’s unexpected observation) should not involve any type of human intervention as a cause, since human interventions have been excluded as a cause of the observed phenomenon during the discussions Otto and Sylvia had with local fishermen.</p>
<p>Please formulate the problem in your own words and use the knowledge you received from your additional reading. Write your problem formulation in the box below. Please be as concise as possible in formulating the problem and keep your formulation below a maximum of 50 words.</p>
<p>Now you have to formulate with your own words the main problem in this situation.</p>
