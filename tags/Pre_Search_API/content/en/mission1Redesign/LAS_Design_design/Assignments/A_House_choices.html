<p>You have just made an ‘Inventory of expert solutions’ by combining the findings of all three expert groups. Now you will use the same schematic drawing one last time to represent the solutions and ideas that you actually decide to use for your own house.</p>
<p>It could be a good idea to start with the ‘Inventory of expert solutions’ and to delete all solutions that your design group decides not to use. So, make a selection of all the appliances that should be in your house. Also try to make a decision regarding the energy source(s) for your house. Of course you also need to discuss the shape, size and other architectural features of your house, and make some choices there.</p>
<p>Probably, this ‘list’ of choices will grow organically throughout the following lessons. So you can add (and delete) items later on, according to the development of the design process.</p>
