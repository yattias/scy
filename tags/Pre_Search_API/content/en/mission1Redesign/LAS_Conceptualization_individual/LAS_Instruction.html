<h1>Create a concept map on CO2-levels</h1>
<p>The goal of this mission is to design a CO2-friendly  house. But why do we want our house to be CO2-friendly? The purpose of this activity is to build a <span class="Bold">concept map</span> that explains the importance of reducing global CO2-levels.  Your concept map should also explain the most important processes of the carbon  cycle.</p>
