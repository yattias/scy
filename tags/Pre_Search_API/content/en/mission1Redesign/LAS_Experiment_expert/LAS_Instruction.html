<title>Conclusion of expert experiments</title>

<h1>Drawing conclusions from data
</h1>
<p>In the process of becoming an expert you will encounter many questions. Some of these questions can readily be answered from the existing literature. Other questions need to be examined experimentally, and that's what this activity is all about. </p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this activity is to test your hypotheses and answer your research questions on the basis of self-conducted experiments. As you can see in the picture below, this process comprises four steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>design experiments, using the <b>experimental procedure tool</b>;</li>
<li>run experiments, using <b>simulations</b> or real equipement;</li>
<li>process data, using the <b>data processing tool</b>;</li>
<li>draw conclusions, and write them down in the <b>text editor</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>You start this activity by designing an experiment for each of your hypotheses. Open the object <b>Hypotheses of my expert group</b> and the <b>Experimental procedure</b> tool to get going.
