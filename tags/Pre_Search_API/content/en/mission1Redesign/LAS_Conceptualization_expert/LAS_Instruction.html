<h1>Becoming an expert
</h1>
<p>You have been assigned a specific expert role: energy expert, insulation expert, or electricity expert. So now it is time for you to become a 'true' expert in your field. But how do you become an expert? How do you ‘build’ knowledge? Of course you are familiar with search engines such as Google, which you use to find information on the internet. But most of the knowledge you find on the internet and in books, was originally produced by ‘people who did some kind of research and wrote about it’. So, in addition to studying existing resources, we also want you to carry out experiments yourself, and thus create ‘new knowledge’. Just like real scientists do.</p>
<p> The steps that you will follow in the process of becoming an expert are depicted in the diagram below. As you can see, there are multiple pathways through the diagram. Basically, there are two main routes. One route runs in ‘theory space’, in which you may recognize the process of studying existing resources described above. The other route flows from ‘theory space’ to ‘experimental space’ and back. So if you do experiments, you have to follow this route. Complicated as it may seem at first sight, once you start working, you will find that each activity follows more or less logically from the previous one. Each step will be explained in detail later on.</p>

<p>Following these steps, your expert group builds up a lot of knowledge on certain aspects of CO2-friendly building. Later on, each of you will be using this knowledge for the benefit of your own design group. But for now you have to operate as a team. It might be wise to divide tasks between the members of your expert group. But by the end of the expert phase, all findings must have been shared, so that each member has acquired more or less the same knowledge and skills.</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>It is often a good idea to start with doing some background reading and study existing resources on your subject. After you have become acquainted with the most important terms and concepts in your field of knowledge, it is time to formulate a couple of research questions. If your question can be answered experimentally, you also have to state hypotheses to articulate your expectations about the unanswered issues in your research questions.
