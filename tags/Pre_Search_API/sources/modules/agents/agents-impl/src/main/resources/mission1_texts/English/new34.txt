How To Build An Eco House

You don't have to be a hippy member of a green fringe group to seriously consider building an eco house. Financially as well as environmentally, if you are building your own home, it is increasingly making sense to eco build. Take a look at our guide to the basics, benefits and practicalities of building green.

Done properly, not only are there huge running cost savings to be made from an eco build, but also an element of future proofing when it comes to current and proposed government regulations and marketability, if and when you come to sell.

For many though, providing a family-safe, non-toxic home and reducing the environmental impact while still enjoying the comforts of modern living remains the main motivation.

It doesn't mean you have to build with straw bales or rammed earth, though these are options; most successful eco builds are very conventional in appearance. But it is much more than just choosing environmentally friendly materials and paint.

The main priority should be designing a home which reduces energy use and therefore production of CO2 (the 'greenhouse gas' carbon dioxide which in excess is blamed for climate change), says Chris Herring, national chair of the Association for Environment Conscious Building.

Conserving water comes a close second. 'Water use is a major issue but not as big an issue worldwide as CO2 emission,' adds Chris, who is also a director of the Green Building Store in Yorkshire.

Consider the following, especially if you normally worry about your car use, or the advent of cheap flights:

* Homes in the UK use three times more energy than all our cars.
* Buildings are the fastest-growing source of the UK's CO2 emissions, currently responsible for 46 per cent, with homes responsible for 27 per cent.
* More than half - 56 per cent - of water supplied is for households, and demand continues to increase.
* Energy use in non-domestic buildings is increasing as fast as fuel for air travel.

Working with the building site's surrounding environment is also important, says Sue Turpin-Brooks, senior lecturer at Plymouth University's environmental building group, and fellow of its Centre for Sustainable Construction. This doesn't just mean the natural surroundings.

'All aspects have to be considered: the location of the materials ie where they come from, how they're transported, the skills and the workforce too. Where do they get their training from, and are they local people so you are putting back something into the local economy?' she says.

Building an energy efficient eco house is highly technical, so it is important to check credentials and skills, which are currently in short supply, says Chris. And you need to properly understand the concept. 'People are getting the wrong messages. Tacking stuff like a wind generator onto your roof won't do it; you have to look at the fabric of the building, otherwise everything else is bolted on. Also if you build a 300 sq m mansion it can never be an eco build - we don't need more space for living in and it will always use more energy than a 80 sq m semi, in terms of heating alone.'
Energy efficiency in housing is becoming increasingly enshrined in government regulations as it aims at CO2 reduction targets. Since June 1 2007, house sellers are now required to provide buyers with an energy performance certificate. This certificate must give ratings for energy and environmental efficiency as well as the home's running costs (lighting, heating and hot water), which are also graded as good, average or poor, and details of the cost of improving this.

If you're building from scratch, even your dream home, it makes sense to consider its marketability should you want to sell. Meanwhile the social housing market already insists builders conform to various eco requirements, such as energy efficiency, as well as considering the local environment.

'There are increasing numbers of architects, developer/builders going down this path, though still too many are building CO2 emitters which you won't be able to heat in 100 years time', says Chris. 'Builders are currently the least of our market. Trade tends to be the most conservative, but it is driven by the consumer and there's a growing steady increase in interest and awareness.'

But Will it Cost More?

The pioneers, as recently as the 1980s, were hampered by a limited or non-existent supply market for materials alone. But things have changed. 'You can build a low energy house as cheaply as you can build a standard house,' says Chris Herring.

He was one of three builders who set up the Green Building Store in 2001 after struggling to source environmentally (and human) friendly building materials, and researching and developing their own, particularly timber and windows.

In the early 1990s they designed and built one of the most energy efficient houses in the UK - Longwood low-energy house in Huddersfield. 'When we built that, it was not much more expensive than a standard house; now it is even easier.'

Sue Turpin-Brooks agrees. 'As more and more people invest in these concerns it's becoming more affordable. The building budget is always going to be an issue but you have to take into account cost over the lifetime of the property as well as the initial cost.' That includes the running costs where owners can look forward to major savings.

This is evident on a large scale in Germany, where thousands of low energy houses have already been built, with ongoing targets to build more, says Chris: 'The advanced German standard achieves 95 per cent less energy use than a current new build.'
The Association for Environment Conscious Building, an independent membership-based organisation, already has its own set of energy standards and offers a handy, impartial check list to would-be eco builders. But design aspects to consider include:

* Insulation, throughout the house; make sure it is not compromised too by building construction, eg the accidental creation of 'thermal bridges' allowing heat to travel out; design should also include airtightness and ventilation.
* Water: conserve and minimise use of water. The average person uses 140 litres per day but should aim to reduce this.
* Energy: includes using natural materials such as wood for burning to heat water while renewable energy systems including wind turbines and solar panels.
* Lighting: should maximize the use of natural light, while energy efficient lighting is used throughout.
* Electrical appliances: eliminating the need for some eg providing a clothes natural drying space, while ensuring A++ energy efficient standard for others.
* Materials: consider those which are natural and from a renewable source; use locally grown timber or that accredited by the Forestry Stewardship Council (ensuring you support responsible forest management worldwide); also more durable wood such as heartwood of English oak reduces the need for preservatives. Look at the energy involved in production/transportation, and use manufacturers which can provide such information. Avoid PVC.
* Recycle or reuse where possible.
