<p><strong>5.3 A simulation of the digestive  system</strong></p>
<p>You are  already familiar with the names of the individual organs of the digestive  system. But what is the function of each particular organ? This is what you  will find out during the following activity.<br />
  1. The class will be divided in seven groups. Each group will collect  information about one particular organ of the digestive system. Your teacher  will tell you which group you are in.<br />
  2. Your teacher will give you a piece of paper (<strong>fact sheet</strong>) with questions about the properties and functions of your  particular organ. Browse the internet to find the answers to these questions.  You can use this website as a starting point:<br />

<p>3. After you have completed your fact sheet, the whole class comes back  together for a <strong>classroom simulation</strong> of the digestive system. You will receive instructions from your teacher. Keep  your fact sheet at hand (or memorize it) for the simulation.<br />
  4. Copy the answers to the questions on your fact sheet here <em>[link to a digital version of the fact sheet,  see Appendix E]</em>.</p>
