<p><strong>Labels of  ingredients </strong><br />
  </p>
<p>Most food packages have a label which gives information about  the ingredients, a 'best before' date and several other nutrition facts. These food labels often include a table with the main nutrient categories (e.g. fats, carbohydrates and proteins) and their quantities. Usually, these values are given for the whole package, or per 100 gram (or 100 ml) of food. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins all provide the human body with energy. Therefore, a food label also tells you how much energy the product contains. Energy is measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ). In the next part of the mission you will learn more about these units. For now, we will work with calories only.</p>
<p>The amount of energy in 1 gram of nutrient depends on the nutrient category. As you can see here below, 1 gram of fat contains more than twice the amount of energy of 1 gram of protein or carbohydrate.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="119" valign="top"><p><strong>nutrient</strong></p></td>
    <td width="162" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>average amount of energy per gram (kcal)</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="119" valign="top"><p>carbohydrate</p></td>
    <td width="162" valign="top"><p align="center">4</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="119" valign="top"><p>fat</p></td>
    <td width="162" valign="top"><p align="center">9</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="119" valign="top"><p>protein</p></td>
    <td width="162" valign="top"><p align="center">4</p></td>

<p>If the amounts of nutrients in a particular food product are known, then the amount of energy it provides can be  calculated. Here we provide an example for a pack of  milk:</p>
<p><img src="file:///P|/Projecten/SCY/WP VIII/MISSION 3 Canteen Cuisine/Mission 3 in SCY-Lab/milk label.JPG" width="330" height="250" /></p>
<p>So if we look at the energy-yielding constituents (protein, fat and carbohydrate), our calculation is as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> 4.6 grams of carbohydrate contains (4.6 x 4 =) 18.4 kcal</li>
  <li> 3.5 grams of fat contains (3.5 x 9 =) 31.5 kcal </li>
  <li> 3.2 grams of protein contains (3.2 x 4 =) 12.8 kcal </li>
</ul>
<p>Summing up these values, we get the total amount of energy (in 100 ml of milk):</p>
<ul>
  <li>	18.4 + 31.5 + 12.8 = 62.7 kcal</li>
</ul>
<p>Now carry out the same calculations for the six food items given in the text.</p>
