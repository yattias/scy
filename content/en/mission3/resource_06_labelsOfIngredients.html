<p>The nutrients of food  - carbohydrates, fat and proteins - provides the human body the energy it needs  to maintain its vital body functions (heart beat regulation, breathing,  digestion, etc.) as well as the energy it needs throughout the day (moving  around, exercising, temperature, etc.). Fat contains almost twice the amount of  energy (calories) compared to carbohydrates or proteins of the same quantity (see  table below). Energy is measured in kilo-calories (kcal) or kilo-Joules (kJ).  One kcal is equal to 1,000 calories or 4.2 kJ. In that perspective, 1 kJ is  equal to 1,000 Joules or 0.24 calories.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<body>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" valign="bottom"><p><strong>Nutrients</strong></p></td>
    <td width="193" colspan="2"><p align="center"><strong>Energy per 1g</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97"><p align="center">kcal/g </p></td>
    <td width="96"><p align="center">kJ/g </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Carbohydrates </p></td>
    <td width="97"><p align="center">4 </p></td>
    <td width="96"><p align="center">16.75 </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Fat </p></td>
    <td width="97"><p align="center">9 </p></td>
    <td width="96"><p align="center">37.68 </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Proteins </p></td>

<p>If the nutrients of a food product (e.g. carbohydrates, fat  and proteins) are known, then the energy (calories) of that product can be  calculated. This corresponds to the total energy of carbohydrates, fat and  proteins contained in a product. Bellow we provide an example for 100mL of  milk. Later on, you will calculate the total caloric intake of your character  from his or her food diary. But first, you are going to practice a little bit  with these calculations.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="590" valign="top"><p>Food provides us with energy, like petrol provides cars with fuel to run    or like coal used in power stations to generate electricity to operate a    factory. We use up energy in whatever activities we do. Physical work, such    as walking, running and exercising, requires energy. Even resting and mental    work, such as thinking, requires energy! Energy is also used in such basic    body processes as the heart beat and digestion in the stomach.<br />

        <br />
        Energy is measured in joules or calories. Both units are very small. So    when talking about the energy value of food and the energy output of body    activities, we multiply the values by one thousand (kilo=1000) and refer to    them as kilojoules or kilocalories. A Kilocalorie is often abbreviated to Calorie    (Cal) spelled with a capital C. (A kilocalorie is defined as the heat energy    needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water from 14.5° to 15.5° C).    We usually use a Calorimeter to measure the energy content of food    substances.<br />

        For conversions, </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>1 kJ = 0.24 Cal </li>
        <li>1 Cal = 4.2 kJ </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Energy is found in carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates are the    most abundant foods in the world, and fats are the most concentrated and    easily stored fuel. If the body exhausts its available carbohydrates and    fats, it can use proteins directly from the diet or break down its own    protein tissue to make fuel.<br />
        <br />
        Average values of energy-yielding constituents</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>One gram         carbohydrates = 3.75 Calories (16 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram proteins =         4 Calories (17 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram fat = 9 Calories         (37 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram alcohol = 7         Calories (29 kJ) </li>
      </ul></td>

  For example: </p>
<p><img src="images/milkIngredients.png" /></p>
<table border="2" width="350" bgcolor="#33CCCC"="">
  <tr>
    <td><strong><u>Energy for 100ml of milk </u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Carbohydrates: 4.6g x 4(kcal/g) = 18.4 kcal</li>
        <li> Fat: 3.5g x 9(kcal/g) = 31.5 kcal </li>
        <li> Proteins: 3.2gx 4(kcal/g) = 12.8 kcal </li>
      </ul>
      Summing up the calories above results in the total energy of milk per 100ml (18.4 + 31.5 + 12.8 = 62.7 kcal)  as written on the label of ingredients.
