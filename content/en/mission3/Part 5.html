<p><strong>5.1 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>During the  previous activities you have learned about nutrients and their function in the  human body. As you remember, the overall goal of this mission is to create a  healthy pizza. But if you are eating your pizza, how do the nutrients enter  your bloodstream? In this activity you will learn about the different organs of  the digestive system and how they work.</p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to explain simple information to the rest of the class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to reproduce the basic anatomy of the digestive system</li>
  <li>able  to explain the function of each organ of the digestive system, especially in  terms of (a) the secretion of digestive juices and (b) the absorption of  nutrients (including water)</li>
  <li>able  to explain that digestive juices contain certain substances (enzymes) that  break down nutrients into substances that are small enough to be absorbed by  the digestive system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.2 A map of the digestive system  (1)</strong></p>
<p>The  digestive system is an organ system. The organs of the digestive system work  together to break down the food you eat, and take up (absorb) the nutrients in  it. Basically, the digestive system is one long hollow canal that runs through  your body from your mouth to your anus. During this activity you will work on a  schematic drawing of the digestive canal. Finally, you will have created your  own &lsquo;map&rsquo; of the digestive system.</p>
<p>1. Open the  schematic drawing of the digestive canal [<em>link  to SCYLab tool with existing image, see appendix D</em>].</p>
<p>2. The  first step is to put the names of the organs on the map. Two names are already  given. Visit this website to find the rest of the names:<br />

<p>3. Put the names on the map.</p>
<p>APPENDIX  D</p>
<p>Please note  that the liver and the gall bladder are not represented in the drawing. These  organs do however play an important role in digestion. The liver produces bile,  which is temporarily stored in the gall bladder. The gall bladder releases bile  into the digestive canal to make the fatty substances in your food more  soluble. In addition, the liver breaks down toxic substances that enter your  body through the digestive system.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.3 A simulation of the digestive  system</strong></p>
<p>You are  already familiar with the names of the individual organs of the digestive  system. But what is the function of each particular organ? This is what you  will find out during the following activity.<br />
  1. The class will be divided in seven groups. Each group will collect  information about one particular organ of the digestive system. Your teacher  will tell you which group you are in.<br />
  2. Your teacher will give you a piece of paper (<strong>fact sheet</strong>) with questions about the properties and functions of your  particular organ. Browse the internet to find the answers to these questions.  You can use this website as a starting point:<br />
  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bioplek.org/animaties/spijsvertering/spijsvertering2.html" target="_external">http://www.bioplek.org/animaties/spijsvertering/spijsvertering2.html</a></p>
<p>3. After you have completed your fact sheet, the whole class comes back  together for a <strong>classroom simulation</strong> of the digestive system. You will receive instructions from your teacher. Keep  your fact sheet at hand (or memorize it) for the simulation.<br />
4. Copy the answers to the questions on your fact sheet here <em>[link to a digital version of the fact sheet,  see Appendix E]</em>.</p>

<p>APPENDIX  E</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.4 A map of the digestive system  (2)</strong></p>
<p>Your  digestive system breaks down the food you eat, and takes up the nutrients in  it. Each organ of the digestive system has its own particular function. In your  mouth, your food is chewed and mixed with saliva. After you swallow, your food  is grinded and pushed through the digestive system by movements of muscles in the  wall of the digestive canal. Now you will turn back to the schematic drawing of  the digestive system and complete the drawing with arrows that depict the  secretion of digestive juices and the uptake of nutrients.</p>
<p>1. Open the  schematic drawing of the digestive canal you have been working on [<em>link to SCYLab tool with existing image, see  Appendix D</em>].</p>
<p>Food contains nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Most  of these nutrients are large molecules that cannot be absorbed by the cells of  our body. These large molecules have to be broken down into smaller molecules  (e.g., starch is broken down to glucose). The digestive system breaks down  large molecules into smaller ones using digestive juices that contain special  substances called enzymes. These enzymes have the ability to break down  particular molecules into smaller molecules. <br />
  2. Use the green arrows to indicate the places in our digestive system  where digestive juices are secreted (as has been done with the mouth). If  necessary, visit this website to fresh up your memory:<br />

<p>Once the nutrients in your digestive system are small enough, they can  be absorbed by the cells of the digestive canal and enter the bloodstream. You  have already learned what organs are responsible for the absorption of  nutrients during the classroom simulation.<br />
3. You have to use the red arrows to indicate the places in our  digestive system where nutrients are absorbed. Use the blue arrows to indicate  the places in our digestive system where water is absorbed. If necessary, visit  this website to fresh up your memory:</p>
