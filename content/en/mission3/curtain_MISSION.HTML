<p>The 'Healthy Pizza' mission addresses the need of healthy meals at school canteens/cafeterias around the world. Today, children in Europe and the United States consume more food products high in sugar, salt and fat content than thirty years ago. This led to the increase of many health problems including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart related disease and other diet-related problems. Thus, the purpose of the Canteen Cuisine mission is to actively engage you in practices related to the canteen/cafeteria cuisine of your school. You will be involved in creating a healthy pizza for your school canteen/cafeteria while taking into consideration the nutritional value of the ingredients, the human digestive system, diet-related health issues and daily exercise.

In order to complete the mission, you will follow a stepwise approach. To move on to the next step, you must first complete the previous one. However, you will have the freedom to revisit the steps you have already completed whenever you wish.
