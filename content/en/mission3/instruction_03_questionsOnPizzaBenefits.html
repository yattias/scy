<p><strong>03: The benefits of eating pizza</strong><br /></p>
<p>
  Pizza is one of  students&rsquo; favorite meals but it is considered to be among the least healthy  products found in many school canteens/cafeterias. According to the results of  a research conducted by the Word Health Organization, there is a large increase  in cancer cases connected to diet while the diet of young children is connected  even more with harmful and unhealthy food products that lead to obesity, as you  watched in the previous video. For this reason, school canteens/cafeterias can  play an important and decisive role since schools provide access to different  kinds of food products for students. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we cannot eat  our favorite food. In many cases, unhealthy food products can be improved by  replacing unhealthy ingredients with healthy ones. Read the article bellow to  learn how researchers in Italy  investigated whether the consumption of pizza may help prevent cancer. Then,  try to answer the following questions: <br />
  <br />
  1. Does the consumption of pizza helps prevent cancer? <br />
  2. Do the Italian researchers provide valid data to support  their claim?<br />
  3. What are the implications of this study for the meaning  of the term &ldquo;unhealthy food?</p>

        <em>International Journal of Cancer, 107</em>, 283–284 (2003)<br />
      </p>
      <p><em>Have you ever thought about preventing cancer by eating pizza? This might  sound a bit unusual or odd, however, Italian scientists (perhaps because pizza  is their national food) conducted a large scale research in order to determine  the relation between the consumption of pizza and cancer.</em></p>
      <p><em>During the study, scientists examined the  eating habits of 3,315 Italians who suffered from various forms of cancer, such  as digestive system, larynx and pharynx (throat) cancer. They also examined 4,999 other patients, who did not have cancer but  were hospitalized for other reasons.  <br />
        </em><br />
        <em>For each patient they did a detailed  analysis of what patients usually ate while taking into consideration other  factors, such as age, gender, family history, consumption of alcohol and  cigarettes and physical exercise throughout their life. <br />
        </em><br />
        <em>The patients were categorized in three  groups based on how much pizza they consumed. Those who did not consume any  pizza at all were placed in the first group. In the second group were those who  consumed pizza one to three times a month while the third and last group were  those who consumed pizza once a week or more often.  </em><br />
        <br />
        <em>The findings of the Italian scientists were very  interesting: </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Those who  consumed more pizza (group 3), compare to those who did not consume any pizza  at all (group 1), had less danger developing mouth, pharynx, esophagus, larynx  and large intestine cancer.</em></li>
        <li><em>Among the  1,255 patients who had large intestine cancer, 503 of them never consumed any  pizza and 473 consumed pizza on rare occasions. In contrast, of those who  consumed pizza on regular bases, only 249 had large intestine cancer. </em></li>
        <li><em>Between  the 598 patients who had mouth and pharynx cancer, 310 never consumed any pizza  and 213 consumed pizza occasionally. Of those who consumed pizza on regular  bases, only 75 had pharynx and mouth cancer.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>These results are impressive, however,  we can not yet support the conclusion that pizza protects against cancer. While  the study was well designed and several precautions were taken into  consideration in order to eliminate the number of factors which lead to errors,  the heterogeneity among the variety of pizza ingredients raises some concerns.  In addition, the study failed to determine the longevity patients were  consuming pizza. </em><br />
        <br />
        <em>While the study gears towards a  certain direction, the exact reasons of what causes this effect must be further  examined. If pizza does protect against cancer, further research must be  carried out to determine the mechanism behind this relation. A possible  explanation that warrants further investigation is the tomato sauce used in all  pizza recipes. Previous studies have shown that the consumption of tomatoes is  negatively related to certain kinds of cancer.</em></p></td>
