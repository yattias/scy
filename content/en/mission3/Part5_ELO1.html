<p><strong>5.2 A map of the digestive system  (1)</strong></p>
<p>The  digestive system is an organ system. The organs of the digestive system work  together to break down the food you eat, and take up (absorb) the nutrients in  it. Basically, the digestive system is one long hollow canal that runs through  your body from your mouth to your anus. During this activity you will work on a  schematic drawing of the digestive canal. Finally, you will have created your  own &lsquo;map&rsquo; of the digestive system.</p>
<p>1. Open the  schematic drawing of the digestive canal [<em>link  to SCYLab tool with existing image, see Appendix D</em>].</p>
<p>2. The  first step is to put the names of the organs on the map. Two names are already  given. Visit this website to find the rest of the names:<br />

<p>3. Put the names on the map.</p>
<p>APPENDIX  D</p>
<p>Please note  that the liver and the gall bladder are not represented in the drawing. These  organs do however play an important role in digestion. The liver produces bile,  which is temporarily stored in the gall bladder. The gall bladder releases bile  into the digestive canal to make the fatty substances in your food more  soluble. In addition, the liver breaks down toxic substances that enter your  body through the digestive system.</p>
