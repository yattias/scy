<p><strong>14: Estimated energy requirements (EER)</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the mission you  have created a personal diet and exercise diary. In this  activity you are going to use the data from the exercise diary to estimate how  much energy you have spent during this period.
The total amount of energy you spend  on a day is of course higher than your BMR. The actual amount of calories your  body needs is expressed in a value known as the estimated energy requirements  (EER, measured in kcal/day). To estimate the EER you are  going to calculate the total amount of calories you have spent for each day in the  exercise diary. A list of activities, and the amount of calories you burn while  doing them is found in the resource drawer. Please be aware that (an  estimate of) the BMR is already included in these numbers.</p>
<p>1. Compose  a spreadsheet that looks like the example below.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>In the first two columns you fill in all       the activities you have performed in one particular day, as well       as the duration of each activity (see the exercise diary). Please note       that duration is given in hours; so 30 minutes equals 0.5 hours.</li>
  <li>Check if the total duration of all the       activities is 24 hours.</li>
  <li>From the list of activities  you copy the estimated amount of calories burned in one       hour (while performing that particular activity). Enter these values in       the third column. If you cannot find information in the list, check one of       the websites <a href="http://primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/calculat.htm" target="_external">(http://primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/calculat.htm</a> and<br />
    <a href="http://health.discovery.com/centers/cholesterol/activity/activity.html" target="_external">http://health.discovery.com/centers/cholesterol/activity/activity.html</a>),       or choose another activity from the list that you feel is approximately as       energy consuming.</li>
  <li>Now calculate the amount of calories       burned for the duration of each activity (fourth column). Multiply the       value in the second column by the value in the third column.</li>
  <li>Calculate the total amount of energy spend       during that day, by adding up all the values in the fourth column. This is       the EER of that particular day.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Follow step a. to b. for each day  in the exercise diary.</p>
<p>3. Calculate your average EER. This value will be used for your Health Passport.</p>
