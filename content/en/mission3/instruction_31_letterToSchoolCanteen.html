<p><strong>31: Letter to the school canteen (reflection)</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Now that you are aware of  the benefits of a healthy diet and the hidden dangers consuming food products  high in fat, sugar and salt content, you should choose the healthier pizza you  have created in order to present it to your school’s canteen/cafeteria. As a  member of the student health committee at your school, write a letter to your school canteen/cafeteria (or school  principle) presenting your pizza. Explain why your pizza provides a  healthier option from what is sold/served  right now at your school.</p>
<p>
Congratulations! You have completed your mission!</p>
