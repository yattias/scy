<p><strong>School canteens</strong><br /></p>
<p>
  Pizza is one of students' favourite meals but it is considered to be among the least healthy products found in many school canteens/cafeterias.
  According to the results of a research conducted by the Word Health Organization, 
  there is a large increase in cancer cases connected to diet while the diet of young children is connected even more with harmful 
  and unhealthy food products that lead to obesity, as you saw in the previous video. 
  For this reason, school canteens/cafeterias can play an important and decisive role 
  since schools provide access to different kinds of food products for students. 
  However, this doesn't mean we should never eat our favourite dish anymore. 
  In many cases, unhealthy food products can be improved by replacing unhealthy ingredients with healthy ones.
