<p><strong>1.4.1: </strong><strong>Your personal food and exercise diary (optional)</strong><br />
  You  probably think you have a reasonable idea of what you eat and drink on an  average day. But do you know how many grams of food you actually consume? Or  how many litres of fluids you drink? Finally, how much do you exercise? Now is  the time to find out. For the duration of one day, you are going to keep track  of everything you eat and drink. You are going to put this information in a  food and exercise diary (see the example below).</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything you eat or       drink on one day (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down the name of       a particular food or drink product, but also note the quantity you have       consumed (in grams or litres).</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about the       weight of a particular food item, you can either check the package or use       a (kitchen) scale or measuring cup to measure it. Sometimes you can find       the information you need on the internet. Once you start doing this, you       will develop a certain feeling about how much things weigh (e.g. an       average sized glass is about 200 mL).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your food  contains energy, which is used by your body for movement, maintaining a  constant body temperature and various other purposes. You will learn more about  the energy your body spends in activity 4. To make your diary complete, you  will also note down everything you do during a day.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything you do in       one day (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down what you       are doing, but also how long you have been doing it (in minutes).</li>
  <li>Even when you are not really       exercising, but just attending class or sleeping (or both at the same       time), your body consumes energy. So, you also have to note these kinds of       activities.</li>
  <li>If you are performing the same       activity twice during one hour (e.g. walking to the video store, and 20       minutes later walking back to your house) you can of course add these two       values up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check the example of a food  and exercise diary to see how you write down the information. Please note that  the information you put in your diary is private. You do not have to share it  with others.</p>
