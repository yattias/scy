<p><strong>01: Create a pizza</strong> <br /></p>
<p>
There is a wide variety of pizza's. Each of us has its own preference for a specific topping. 
What would  your favourite pizza look like?
Use the pizza simulation to create your own pizza by selecting your favourite crust, sauce, cheese(s), vegetables, meats and fish. 
A '1' indicates a regular portion of a normal size. Extra portions are of course possible.
You will need this pizza later in the mission. Good luck!</p>
