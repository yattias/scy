<p><strong>17: Food and health problems </strong></p>
<p>Unhealthy  food can be very tasty. Many people are fond of fast food products such as  French fries, hamburgers and chicken nuggets. But eating fast food on a daily  basis is not without consequences. Your teacher will show you parts of a documentary  called &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;. In this documentary, we follow Morgan Spurlock from New York, who engages in  a bizarre experiment: he will eat only fast food (at McDonalds) three meals a  day, for thirty days in a row. A number of physicians monitor his physical and  mental health during this experiment. After watching the documentary there will  be a classroom discussion. Finally, you will have to write short comments on a  set of statements related to this topic.</p>
<p>1. Watch the documentary &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo; (shown by your teacher).</p>
<p>2. There  will be a classroom discussion on some of the issues brought forward by the documentary.  In preparation for the discussion, write short comments on paper (50 words  maximum) to each of the following statements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diet-related health problems       such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are a major threat       to our society.</li>
  <li>Eating healthy is entirely your       own responsibility.</li>
  <li>Soft drinks (such as coke or       lemonade) fit well in a healthy diet.</li>
  <li>School canteens should not sell       fast food products at all.</li>
  <li>Fast food restaurants (such as       McDonalds) should provide customers with more information about the       nutritional value of their products.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Participate  in the classroom discussion led by your teacher.</p>
<p>4. After the classroom discussion, write down your final comments in the text.</p>
<p>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Health Passport" and the "Body Mass Index" activity.</p>
