<p><strong>09: Food pyramid  simulation </strong><br /></p>
<p>The simulation below provides the structure of the (new) food  pyramid and several food 
  products. Your job is to place each food product in the appropriate category. In case you misplace a product, the simulator will  let you know. However, it will not tell you which product was misplaced; you  must find it on your own. Good luck!</p>

<p>What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Health Passport" and the "Daily Calorie Intake" activity.</p>
