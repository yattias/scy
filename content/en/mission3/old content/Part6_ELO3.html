<p><strong>6.3 Health passport</strong></p>
<p>You are now  going to finish the health passport for the character you have chosen. This health  passport brings together the most important facts regarding his/her diet and  health. During previous activities you have already calculated the daily  calorie intake, BMR and EER of your character. You have also evaluated his/her  diet. To complete the health passport, you will calculate the body mass index  (BMI), enter a realistic value for the heart rate and write some conclusions  and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Body Mass Index</strong><br />
  The Body  Mass Index (BMI) is used to indicate whether someone has a healthy body weight.  You probably remember the dietician measuring Morgan&rsquo;s bodyweight in &lsquo;Super  Size Me&rsquo;. To calculate the BMI, you need to know the weight (in kilograms) and  the height (in metres) of a person.</p>
<p>1. Use the  formula below to calculate the BMI of your character. Of course you have to use  the same values for the weight and the height of your character as in activity  4 (so check the health passport).</p>
<p>FIGURE 2 </p>
<p>If you do not know how to use this formula,  follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take  the height of your character in meters.</li>
  <li>Multiply  this value by itself.</li>
  <li>Divide  the weight of your character (in kg) by the outcome of the previous step.</li>
  <li>The  outcome is the BMI.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Enter  the BMI of your character in the health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see appendix A]</em>.</p>
<p>Now that  you have calculated the BMI, you probably want to know what this value says  about physical health. There are roughly four different categories:</p>
<p>Underweight                 your BMI is under 18.5<br />
  Normal weight              your BMI is in  between 18.5 and 25<br />
  Overweight                   your BMI is in between 25 and 30<br />
  Obese                           your  BMI is over 30</p>
<p>If you  would like to know your own BMI, you can use the same formula of course. But  before jumping to conclusions, you should be aware that these categories  normally apply to adults. Your body is still developing and growing, and your  BMI might change considerably over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate</strong> <br />
  You have  seen the physicians that were monitoring Morgan&rsquo;s health in &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;  measuring his heart rate and blood pressure. These values might provide  information about a person&rsquo;s health. Even though we are not physicians, and  therefore cannot make a reliable medical interpretation, it might be  interesting to measure our heart rate as well.</p>
<p>Heart rate  is measured in beats per minute (bpm). You probably know that your heart beats  a lot faster when you are exercising. For the health passport we need the <em>resting heart rate</em>. This is the heart  rate when a person is awake, but not doing any physical work. A healthy resting  heart rate will be somewhere in between 60 and 80 bpm for adults. For  teenagers, the outer limits of this healthy range are set even further apart.  Resting heart rates of 90 bpm are no exception. But heart rates below 60 bpm  are also common, especially if you exercise regularly.</p>
<p>1. Enter a  realistic value for the heart rate of your character in the health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see appendix A]</em>.  As a (very) general rule you might say that the resting heart rate becomes  lower if a person exercises more regularly.</p>
<p><em>Measuring your own heart rate</em><br />
  There are a  number of places on your body where you can feel your own pulse. A good place  to start looking for it would be your neck, where you probably will be able to  find the pulse of the so called carotid artery just below your chin (see the  drawing below).</p>
<p>FIGURE  3</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sit  down and relax your muscles. Place two fingers of one hand just below your chin  and try to find your pulse. Hold a stopwatch in your other hand. Once you have  found your pulse, start the stopwatch and count the number of heartbeats for  one minute.</li>
  <li>Ask  two of your fellow students to measure your heart rate as well.</li>
  <li>Calculate  the average of these three measurements. This value will be a reasonably good  estimate of your heart rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong> <br />
2. Complete  the health passport with a short reflection (150 words maximum). Evaluate the balance  between daily calorie intake and the estimated energy requirements of your  character. Also note if there are any signs of an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. a  BMI that is too high). Formulate a few recommendations for your character on  how to improve his/her dietary and exercising habits.</p>
<p><strong>Physical fitness</strong> (optional)<br />
Another  measure that is indicative of a person&rsquo;s health is physical endurance. In  &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo; you saw Morgan running on a treadmill. You are also going to do  a fitness test. Your teacher will give you more detailed instructions on how to  proceed.</p>
