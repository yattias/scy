<p><strong>4.1 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In the  previous activity you have studied food pyramids. The food pyramid is designed  to show the optimal balance between different categories of food products. But  you probably remember the staircase at the left side of the new food pyramid: a  reference to your exercising behaviour. It is not only the composition of your  diet that matters, the quantity is also important. There has to be a balance  between the amount of calories in your food, and the amount of energy you  spend. And that depends on the activities you undertake throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to handle large amounts of data in a spread sheet tool</li>
  <li>perform simple calculations (e.g. additions and  multiplications). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>aware  of the importance of regular exercise for their health</li>
  <li>able  to explain how energy is measured</li>
  <li>able  to give examples of processes of the human body that require energy</li>
  <li>able  to explain what factors the energy need of a person depend upon</li>
  <li>able  to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), and explain what the BMR is</li>
  <li>able  to calculate the estimated energy requirements (EER), using an energy diary and  a given list of activities</li>
  <li>able  to evaluate the balance between calorie intake and use of calories by the human  body</li>
</ul>
