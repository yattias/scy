<p><strong>3.2: Food pyramid  simulation </strong><br />
  The simulation bellow provides the structure of the new food  pyramid and several food 
  products. Your job is to place each food product in the  appropriate pyramid group. In case you misplace a product, the simulator will  let you know. However, it will not tell you which product was misplaced; you  must find it on your own. Good luck!</p>
