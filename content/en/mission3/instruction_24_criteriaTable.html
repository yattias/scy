<p><strong>24: Criteria table </strong><strong>(Pizza optimization first  step</strong>)<br />
</p>
<p>In  order to apply the optimization strategy in the context of a healthy pizza, you  should follow a process similar to the one followed by Mr. Adam when purchasing  a car. Before you begin, however, first you need to recall <em>all the ingredients</em>  you selected during the first and second pizza simulation (activities 1 and 21)  and create a table listing the amount of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates,  protein, etc.) and energy (in kcal) of each of the pizza ingredient you chose.</p>
<p>Now you will have to score each  ingredient you selected up to this point so that you exalt all the criteria  (fats, carbohydrates, proteins and costs) on a common scale. After you have finished, exchange the table with one  of your group members for peer-assessment.</p>
<p>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please proceed with the "Criteria Weight Table" activity.</p>
