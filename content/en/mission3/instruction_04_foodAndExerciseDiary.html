<p><strong>04: </strong><strong>Your personal food and exercise diary</strong><br />
  </p>
<p>You probably think you have a reasonable idea of what you eat and drink  on an average day. But do you know how many grams of food you actually consume?  Or how many litres of fluids you drink? Finally, how much do you exercise? Now  is the time to find out. For the duration of three days, you are going to keep  track of everything you eat and drink. You are going to put this information in  a food and exercise diary.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note down <em>everything you eat or drink</em> on three       consecutive days (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down the name of a particular food       or drink product, but also note the quantity you have consumed (in grams       or litres). </li>
  <li>If you consume more than one food item in a particular hour, you will have to add a new row (or new rows) for the additional items.</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about the weight of a       particular food item, you can either check the package or use a (kitchen)       scale or measuring cup to measure it. Sometimes you can find the       information you need on the internet. Once you start doing this, you will       develop a certain feeling about how much things weigh (e.g. an average       sized glass is about 200 mL).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your food contains energy, which is used by your body for movement,  maintaining a constant body temperature and various other purposes. You will  learn more about the energy your body spends later on in the mission. To make your diary  complete, you will also note down everything you do during a day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note down <em>everything you do</em> in three days (from       midnight to midnight). </li>
  <li>Not only write down what you are doing, but also       how long you have been doing it (in minutes).</li>
  <li>Add new rows if you perform more than one particular activity within one hour.</li>
  <li>Even when you are not really exercising, but just       attending class or sleeping (or both at the same time), your body consumes       energy. So, you also have to note these kinds of activities.</li>
  <li>If you are performing the same activity twice       during one hour (e.g. walking to the video store, and 20 minutes later       walking back to your house) you can of course add these two values up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_04_foodAndExerciseDiary_extra.html" target ="_moreResources">example of a food and exercise diary</a> to see how you note down  the information. Please note that the information you put in your diary is  private. You do not have to share it with others.</p>
<p>What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Nutrients and Energy Calculations" and the "Nutrition Table" activity.</p>
