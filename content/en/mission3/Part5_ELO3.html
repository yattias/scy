<p><strong>5.4 A map of the digestive system  (2)</strong></p>
<p>Your  digestive system breaks down the food you eat, and takes up the nutrients in  it. Each organ of the digestive system has its own particular function. In your  mouth, your food is chewed and mixed with saliva. After you swallow, your food  is grinded and pushed through the digestive system by movements of muscles in the  wall of the digestive canal. Now you will turn back to the schematic drawing of  the digestive system and complete the drawing with arrows that depict the  secretion of digestive juices and the uptake of nutrients.</p>
<p>1. Open the  schematic drawing of the digestive canal you have been working on [<em>link to SCYLab tool with existing image, see  Appendix D</em>].</p>
<p>Food contains nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Most  of these nutrients are large molecules that cannot be absorbed by the cells of  our body. These large molecules have to be broken down into smaller molecules  (e.g., starch is broken down to glucose). The digestive system breaks down  large molecules into smaller ones using digestive juices that contain special  substances called enzymes. These enzymes have the ability to break down  particular molecules into smaller molecules. <br />

  2. Use the green arrows to indicate the places in our digestive system  where digestive juices are secreted (as has been done with the mouth). If  necessary, visit this website to fresh up your memory:<br />

<p>Once the nutrients in your digestive system are small enough, they can  be absorbed by the cells of the digestive canal and enter the bloodstream. You  have already learned what organs are responsible for the absorption of  nutrients during the classroom simulation.<br />

3. You have to use the red arrows to indicate the places in our  digestive system where nutrients are absorbed. Use the blue arrows to indicate  the places in our digestive system where water is absorbed. If necessary, visit  this website to fresh up your memory:</p>
