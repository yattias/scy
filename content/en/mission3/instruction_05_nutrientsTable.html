  </p>
<p>During  the previous activity, you have created a food and exercise diary for a  fictitious character. You have probably selected a large variety of food items  for him or her to eat. But what exactly is in all these food products that your  body needs? Now you will learn that everything you eat or drink contains  different (combinations of) nutrients. In this activity you will learn about  nutrients and their function in the human body. Visit the following Internet  resources and complete the table below:</p>

</ul>
<p>Please complete the table. Under 'Nutrients' list  the six nutrient categories (A.-F.). Then, fill in their three main functions (G.-I.)  under 'Function'.
