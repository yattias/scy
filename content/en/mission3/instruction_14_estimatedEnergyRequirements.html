<p><strong>14: Estimated energy requirements (EER)</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the mission you  have created a personal diet and exercise diary. 
In this activity you are going to use the data from the exercise diary to estimate how  much energy you have spent during this period.
The total amount of energy you spend on a day is of course higher than your BMR. 
The actual amount of calories your body needs is expressed in a value known as the estimated energy requirements (EER, measured in kcal/day). 
To estimate the EER you are going to calculate the total amount of calories you have spent for each day in the exercise diary.</p>
<p>
Read the <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/instruction_14_estimatedEnergyRequirements_popup.html" target ="_moreResources">instructions</a> to learn the procedure for calculating the EER. 
</p><p>
Use the <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/resource_14_activityList.html" target ="_moreResources">list of activities</a> to find the amount of calories you burn during each particular activity. 
</p>

<p>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Map of the Digestive System" and the "Map of the Digestive System" activity.</p>
