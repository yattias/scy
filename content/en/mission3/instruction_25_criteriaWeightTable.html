<p><strong>25: Criteria weight table (pizza optimization second  step)</strong><strong></strong><br />
  </p>
<p>Recall the second step of the optimization strategy applied  by Mr. Adam in the example with the cars. Follow a similar process and assign weights (between 1 and 10) to each of the four criteria. The higher the score, the more important you think this criterion is.</p>
<p>For example.<br />
Personally, from all nutrients, I value proteins the most as  they are the building blocks of all muscles. Fiber is important because it  supports the well being of the intestines and helps with digestion. However,  fiber is not as important as proteins. Carbohydrates are also important since  they are one of the resources of energy my body needs to function. Finally, while  fat is still necessary for our bodies, too much of it can cause a lot of health  problems. Therefore, I weight each nutrient as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="139" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Weight</strong></p></td>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Fats</strong></p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Proteins</strong></p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Fiber</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="139" valign="top"><p align="center">(enter weight here)</p></td>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p align="center">4</p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center">9</p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center">7</p></td>
    <td width="118" valign="top"><p align="center">6</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
