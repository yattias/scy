<p><strong>1.1: Create a pizza</strong> <br />
  Hello and welcome to Canteen Cuisine. Pizza is highly  popular among both children and adults. However, there is a wide variety of  pizzas that differ with regard to the type of crust and toppings. What would  your favorite pizza look like? Use the pizza simulation bellow to create your  own pizza by selecting your favorite crust, sauce, cheese(s), vegetables, meats  and fish for your pizza. You will need this pizza later in the mission. Good  luck!</p>

  <strong>1.2:</strong> <strong>Video on  unhealthy diet.</strong><br />
  Now you have created your own favorite pizza, let's watch a video about unhealthy food at school canteens/cafeterias. At the end of the video you will have to answer the following question using the text editor tool: What is the message Jamie is trying to send to students with the video you just watched? Talk with your group members and present your thoughts to the rest of the class. <br />

  1.3:</strong> <strong>The benefits of eating pizza</strong><br />
  Pizza is one of  students&rsquo; favorite meals but it is considered to be among the least healthy  products found in many school canteens/cafeterias. According to the results of  a research conducted by the Word Health Organization, there is a large increase  in cancer cases connected to diet while the diet of young children is connected  even more with harmful and unhealthy food products that lead to obesity, as you  watched in the previous video. For this reason, school canteens/cafeterias can  play an important and decisive role since schools provide access to different  kinds of food products for students. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we cannot eat  our favorite food. In many cases, unhealthy food products can be improved by  replacing unhealthy ingredients with healthy ones. Read the article bellow to  learn how researchers in Italy  investigated whether the consumption of pizza may help prevent cancer. Then,  try to answer the following questions: <br />
  1. Does the consumption of pizza helps prevent cancer? <br />
  2. Do the Italian researchers provide valid data to support  their claim?<br />
3. What are the implications of this study for the meaning  of the term &ldquo;unhealthy food?</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Does pizza protect  against cancer?</strong> <br />
        <em>International Journal of Cancer, 107</em>, 283–284 (2003)<br />
      </p>
      <p><em>Have you ever thought about preventing cancer by eating pizza? This might  sound a bit unusual or odd, however, Italian scientists (perhaps because pizza  is their national food) conducted a large scale research in order to determine  the relation between the consumption of pizza and cancer.</em></p>
      <p><em>During the study, scientists examined the  eating habits of 3,315 Italians who suffered from various forms of cancer, such  as digestive system, larynx and pharynx (throat) cancer. They also examined 4,999 other patients, who did not have cancer but  were hospitalized for other reasons.  <br />
      </em><br />
      <em>For each patient they did a detailed  analysis of what patients usually ate while taking into consideration other  factors, such as age, gender, family history, consumption of alcohol and  cigarettes and physical exercise throughout their life. <br />
      </em><br />
        <em>The patients were categorized in three  groups based on how much pizza they consumed. Those who did not consume any  pizza at all were placed in the first group. In the second group were those who  consumed pizza one to three times a month while the third and last group were  those who consumed pizza once a week or more often.  </em><br />
        <br />
      <em>The findings of the Italian scientists were very  interesting: </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Those who  consumed more pizza (group 3), compare to those who did not consume any pizza  at all (group 1), had less danger developing mouth, pharynx, esophagus, larynx  and large intestine cancer.</em></li>
        <li><em>Among the  1,255 patients who had large intestine cancer, 503 of them never consumed any  pizza and 473 consumed pizza on rare occasions. In contrast, of those who  consumed pizza on regular bases, only 249 had large intestine cancer. </em></li>
        <li><em>Between  the 598 patients who had mouth and pharynx cancer, 310 never consumed any pizza  and 213 consumed pizza occasionally. Of those who consumed pizza on regular  bases, only 75 had pharynx and mouth cancer.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>These results are impressive, however,  we can not yet support the conclusion that pizza protects against cancer. While  the study was well designed and several precautions were taken into  consideration in order to eliminate the number of factors which lead to errors,  the heterogeneity among the variety of pizza ingredients raises some concerns.  In addition, the study failed to determine the longevity patients were  consuming pizza. </em><br />
        <br />
      <em>While the study gears towards a  certain direction, the exact reasons of what causes this effect must be further  examined. If pizza does protect against cancer, further research must be  carried out to determine the mechanism behind this relation. A possible  explanation that warrants further investigation is the tomato sauce used in all  pizza recipes. Previous studies have shown that the consumption of tomatoes is  negatively related to certain kinds of cancer.</em></p></td>

<p><strong>1.4.1: </strong><strong>Your personal food and exercise diary (optional)</strong><br />
  You  probably think you have a reasonable idea of what you eat and drink on an  average day. But do you know how many grams of food you actually consume? Or  how many litres of fluids you drink? Finally, how much do you exercise? Now is  the time to find out. For the duration of one day, you are going to keep track  of everything you eat and drink. You are going to put this information in a  food and exercise diary (see the example below).</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything you eat or       drink on one day (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down the name of       a particular food or drink product, but also note the quantity you have       consumed (in grams or litres).</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about the       weight of a particular food item, you can either check the package or use       a (kitchen) scale or measuring cup to measure it. Sometimes you can find       the information you need on the internet. Once you start doing this, you       will develop a certain feeling about how much things weigh (e.g. an       average sized glass is about 200 mL).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your food  contains energy, which is used by your body for movement, maintaining a  constant body temperature and various other purposes. You will learn more about  the energy your body spends in activity 4. To make your diary complete, you  will also note down everything you do during a day.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything you do in       one day (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down what you       are doing, but also how long you have been doing it (in minutes).</li>
  <li>Even when you are not really       exercising, but just attending class or sleeping (or both at the same       time), your body consumes energy. So, you also have to note these kinds of       activities.</li>
  <li>If you are performing the same       activity twice during one hour (e.g. walking to the video store, and 20       minutes later walking back to your house) you can of course add these two       values up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check the example of a food  and exercise diary to see how you write down the information. Please note that  the information you put in your diary is private. You do not have to share it  with others.</p>
<p><strong><br />
  1.4.2: Create a food and exercise diary</strong> <br />
The goal of  this mission is to create a healthy pizza. But in order to do that, you need to  know some things. For instance, you have to be able to calculate the amount of  nutrients and energy in a particular food item. You must also know how to  estimate the amount of energy your body uses while performing a particular  activity. You will practice all these skills during the mission. But if we want  to do calculations, we need numbers. And you will create these data yourself.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Pick one <strong>character</strong> from the list of characters [link to list with       descriptions]. This will be your alter-ego for the rest of the mission.</li>
  <li>Based on the description of       your character, you will create a detailed <strong>food and exercise diary</strong>. So, try to imagine what your       character would eat and drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner. What kind       of snacks would he or she consume (and how many)? And what kind of       activities will he or she perform throughout the day?</li>
  <li>Try to be as <strong>realistic</strong> as possible. You will       need these data throughout the mission for further calculations.</li>
  <li>Near the end of the mission       (during activity 6) you will compile a <strong>health passport</strong> [link to health passport] for the character       you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for creating a food and exercise  diary</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>First check the example of a       food and exercise diary to get an impression how it should look.</li>
  <li>Write down everything your       character eats or drinks in a period of three days (from midnight to       midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down the name of       a particular food product, but also note the quantity he or she has       consumed (in grams or litres).</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about what       would be a realistic weight of a particular food item, you can:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>check  food packages at home or in a supermarket</li>
  <li>use  a (kitchen) scale or measuring cup to measure it</li>
  <li>find  the information you need on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start doing this, you will develop a  certain feeling about how much things weigh (e.g. an average sized glass is  about 200 ml).</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
  <li>Note down everything your       character does in a period of three days (from midnight to midnight).</li>
  <li>Not only write down what he or       she is doing, but also how long he or she does it (in minutes).</li>
  <li>Even when your character is not       really exercising, but just attending class or sleeping (or both at the       same time), his or her body consumes energy. So, you also have to note       these kinds of activities.</li>
  <li>If your character is performing       the same activity twice during one hour (e.g. walking to the video store,       and 20 minutes later walking back to your house) you can of course add       these two values up.</li>
