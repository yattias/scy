<p><strong>Create a map of the digestive system</strong></p>
<p>The  digestive system is an organ system. The organs of the digestive system work  together to break down the food you eat, and take up (absorb) the nutrients in  it. Basically, the digestive system is one long hollow canal that runs through  your body from your mouth to your anus. During this activity you will work on a  schematic drawing of the digestive canal. Finally, you will have created your  own &lsquo;map&rsquo; of the digestive system.</p>
<p>1. The  first step is to put the names of the organs on the map. Two names are already  given. Visit this website to find the rest of the names:<br />

<p>2. Enter the names of the organs in the map (click the 'T'-symbol in the menu).</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p><em>Before proceeding with the last two steps, complete activity 16 (Fact Sheet Of One Organ) first.</em></p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Now you will turn back to the schematic drawing of the digestive system and complete the drawing with arrows that depict the secretion of digestive juices and the uptake of nutrients. Most nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats) are large molecules that cannot be absorbed by the cells of our body. These large molecules have to be broken down into smaller molecules (e.g., starch is broken down to glucose). The digestive system breaks down  large molecules into smaller ones using digestive juices that contain special substances called <em>enzymes</em>. These enzymes have the ability to break down  particular molecules into smaller molecules. <br />
  <br />
  3. Draw green arrows (click the pencil in the menu and select a green colour) to indicate the places in our digestive system where digestive juices are secreted (as has been done with the mouth). If  necessary, visit this website to fresh up your memory:<br />

<p>Once the nutrients in your digestive system are small enough, they can  be absorbed by the cells of the digestive canal and enter the bloodstream. You  have already learned what organs are responsible for the absorption of  nutrients during the classroom simulation.<br />
    <br />
  4. Draw red arrows to indicate the places in our digestive system where nutrients are absorbed. Draw blue arrows to indicate the places in our digestive system where water is absorbed. If necessary, visit  this website to fresh up your memory:</p>
