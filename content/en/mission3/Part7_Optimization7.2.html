<p><strong>7.2: Optimization strategy </strong><br />
  In the next activity you will study  an example of the optimization strategy, which will help you choose the  healthiest pizza ingredients. The optimization strategy is a method used to  make a decision when more than one option is available. The strategy calls for  a two-step process. During the first step, the parameters of each option are  identified and scored on a common scale, based on their characteristics. During  the second step, all parameters are weighted based on their importance and  multiplied with their scale score. The total score for each option is obtained  by summing up all parameter scores of each option. The best option has the  highest score.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of the optimization strategy: 1st step</strong><br />
  Mr. Adam is about to buy a new car.  He has already done some research and has excluded various models of cars. Now  he is down to a choice of three:</p>
<p>FIGURE 4</p>
<p>Mr. Adam will buy one of the above  cars and his choice will be based exclusively on the following criteria: (a)  cost (the cheaper the better) (b) fuel consumption (the least the better) (c)  duration of guarantee provided by the dealer (the longer the better). The  following table provides the information for each car concerning the three  specific criteria:</p>
<p>TABLE 9</p>
<p>As you can see in the table above,  it is very difficult for Mr. Adam to choose among the three cars which one is  better. Car B is the cheapest vehicle and has the lowest fuel consumption,  however, it has the shortest guarantee time. Car A on the other hand, has a  longer guaranty but consumes a bit more fuel and it cost more money than car B.  Finally, car C has the longest guarantee but it&rsquo;s much more expensive and it  consumes a lot more fuel. Since, Mr. Adam wants to take into account these  three criteria, you should find out which one of the three cars offers the best  combination of advantages and disadvantages. Discuss with your teammates how  Mr. Adam could overcome this problem.</p>
