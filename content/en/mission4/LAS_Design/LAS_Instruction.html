<h1>Design
</h1>
<p>In this part of the mission you are going to join a couple of classmates to design an experimental procedure. You are going to define each step in the experimental process as precisely as possible, e.g. what are the techniques that you are going to employ, what materials do you need, and in what amounts, etcetera. Think carefully, because in the next part of the mission you will actually perform the experiment that your team has designed.</p><br />
<h2>Learning goals
</h2>
<p>After completion of this part of the missionâ€¦
<li>you can follow an experimental process to answer a research question:</li>
- formulate correct hypotheses.<br />
- design experiments related to these hypotheses.
