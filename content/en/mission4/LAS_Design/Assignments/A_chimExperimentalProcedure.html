<h1>Experimental procedure
</h1>
<p>The next step in the mission is to design the experiment. You will do this collaboratively in a group of students. You have several inks that need to be tested: one corresponds to the anonymous letter where the ink has to be extracted first; the other ones belong to the collected pens that can be used directly. You have to investigate if there is a match between the ink of the anonymous letter and ink of the pens.<br />
<br />
Make sure you work extremely precisely and record exactly what you are going to do. Sloppy work may result in the crime not being solved! You have to take the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Copy/paste the "Goal of the analysis" you have written before.<br /> 
2. Write a hypothesis by finishing the following sentence: “If the ink of the anonymous letter..., then...”<br />
3. Describe the principle of the manipulation.<br />
4. Describe what materials you are going to use during the experiment. Also specify the quantities you will use.<br />
5. Describe the experiment step by step.</p>
