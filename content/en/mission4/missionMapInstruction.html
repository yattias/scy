<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>. The following lessons you will work as forensic researchers, scientists that try to answer all sorts of questions related to legal issues. You will be engaged in a real investigation and will have to:
<li>discover your domain of expertise,</li>
<li>discover the technic of analysis chosen according to the samples you will be provided with,</li>
<li>elaborate or finetune your experimental procedure,</li>
<li>carry out the experiment and analyse your results.</li>
The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general.<br />
<br />
In the left cycle of the mission map, your expertise will be DNA profiling. Your job will be to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
Optionnaly, you will be asked to make the right cycle of the mission map. If so, you will be an expert in chemical analyses, and your job will be to analyse and compare chemical traces of substances found in strategic locations: i.e. anonymous letter and suspect's house.<br />
<br />
DNA profiling and chemical analyses involve a lot of lab work. You have to make sure that your experimental procedure is correct, and that you work really carefully. In order to help you, you are provided with a handbook [hyperlink] that you can consult all during the mission. At some points, you will be provided with webnews. They will give you clues to understand the case you actually work on.<br />
<br />
Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles or 2 chemical substances, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found? Your report to the judge must include a section on this issue.</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>

	<span class="minorTitle">Learning goals</span><br />
	After completion of the mission, you will have learnt a lot about biology, mathematics, chemistry and...
  		<ul><li>You can extract, organize and critically evaluate data on a definite subject.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>You can follow an experimental process to answer a question:<br />
        -	write correct hypotheses<br />
        -	design and carry out experiments related to expressed hypotheses<br />
        -	use ICT to express and exploit my results: tables, graphical representations…</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>You can take into account scientific, economic, ethical and moral standpoints. You can form an opinion on one or more personal and/or societal issues.</li>
    	</ul>
