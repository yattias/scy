<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>. The following lessons you will work as forensic researchers (i.e. scientists that try to answer all sorts of questions related to legal issues). Your expertise is DNA profiling, and your job is to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects. DNA profiling involves a lot of lab work. You have to make sure that your experimental procedure is correct, and that you work really carefully. The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general. Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found? Your report to the judge must include a section on this issue.</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>
