<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>. The following lessons you will work as forensic researchers (i.e. scientists that try to answer all sorts of questions related to legal issues).<br />
Your expertise is DNA profiling, and your job is to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
DNA profiling involves a lot of lab work. You have to make sure that your experimental procedure is correct, and that you work really carefully. The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general. Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found? Your report to the judge must include a section on this issue.</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>

<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>. The following lessons you will work as forensic researchers (i.e. scientists that try to answer all sorts of questions related to legal issues).<br />
Your first expertise is DNA profiling, and your job is to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
Your second expertise is chemical analyses, and your job is to analyse and compare chemical traces of substances found in strategic locations: i.e. crime scene and suspect's house.<br />
DNA profiling and chemical analyses involve a lot of lab work. You have to make sure that your experimental procedures are correct, and that you work really carefully. The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general. Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found? Your report to the judge must include a section on this issue.</p>
