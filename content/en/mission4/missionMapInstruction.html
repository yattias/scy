<h1>The Forensic SCY-Lab
</h1>
<p>Welcome to <span class="Bold">The Forensic SCY-Lab</span>.<br />
<br />
In the mission map you will find 2 parts: a biological part on the left and a chemical part on the right.<br />
In the biological part, your expertise will be <span class="Bold">DNA profiling</span>. Your job will be to analyse and compare DNA from traces found at a particular crime scene with DNA samples taken from the victim and a small number of suspects.<br />
Then, you will have to make the chemical part of the mission map. You will be an <span class="Bold">expert in chemical analyses</span>, and your job will be to analyse and compare chemical traces of substances found in strategic locations: i.e. anonymous letter and suspect's house.<br />
<br />
In order to help you, you are provided with a handbook that you can consult in the resource drawers throughout the mission. At some points, you will be provided with webnews. They will give you clues to understand the case you actually work on. But in order to see them, you will have to click on the "I am finished" button at the end of each task, don't forget to do it!<br />
<br />
The end-result of your lab work will be an official report for the attorney general.<br />
Be aware that the verdict of the judge will be based – at least partly – on your analysis. But if you find a match between two DNA profiles or 2 chemical substances, does that imply that the perpetrator has been found?</p>
<p class="Bold">Good luck!</p>

	After completion of the mission, you will have learnt a lot about biology, mathematics, chemistry and:
  		<ul><li>You can extract, organize and critically evaluate information on a definite subject.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>You can follow an experimental process to answer a question:<br />
        -	by writing correct hypotheses,<br />
        -	by designing and carrying out experiments related to expressed hypotheses,<br />
        -	by using ICT to express and exploit my results: tables, graphical representations.</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>You can take account of scientific, ethical and moral standpoints when forming an opinion on one or more personal and/or societal issues.</li>
