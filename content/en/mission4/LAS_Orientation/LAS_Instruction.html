<p>Six samples are sent to your laboratory by the attorney general. These six samples are all related to the same murder case (case number CY0347), and include one <span class="Bold">evidence sample</span> that need to be compared to five <span class="Bold">reference samples</span>, namely:</p>
<li>the evidence sample: a sample collected at the crime scene itself (blood trace)</li>
<li>a sample taken from the victim</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect A</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect B</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect C</li>
<li>a sample taken from suspect D</li>
<p>The assignment of the attorney general is the following:</p>
<p>“Possible cell material should be taken from the crime scene sample in order to produce a DNA-profile, after which the obtained DNA-profile should be compared with the profile of the arrested, or yet to be arrested, suspects and third-party (victim) in this investigation. In case no match is found, the crime scene profile should be saved in the DNA database and compared to other profiles in the database.”</p>
<p>In this part of the mission you will select the techniques that you have to employ for your query.</p>

        <ul><li>you can explain the role of DNA as a coding biopolymer for proteins.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>you can explain the differences between coding and non-coding DNA.</li></ul>
