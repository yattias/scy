<h1>Information
</h1>
<p>You are an expert on DNA. Your job is to isolate DNA from the (biological) samples that are sent to your lab. The quality of these samples partly depends on how they are collected by your colleagues at the crime scene itself (the crime scene examiners). In this first part of the mission you will write a checklist for crime scene examiners on how to collect, store and transport samples.</p>

<h1>Information
</h1>
<p>You are an expert in DNA profiling or chemical analysis. Your job is to analyse samples that are sent to your lab. This can only be done successfully if you first understand the concepts related to the experiments you will carry on.</p>

<p>When you are an expert in chemical analysis, you will make a concept map including the concepts related to the techniques that you know and that can be used in chemical analysis. As you will use Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) in this mission, chromatography will be a central concept of the map.</p>
