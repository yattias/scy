<p>You are an expert in chemical analysis. Your job is to analyse samples that are sent to your lab. This can only be done successfully if you first understand the concepts related to the experiments you will carry on.<br />
<br />
you will make a concept map including the concepts related to the techniques that you know and that can be used in chemical analysis. As you will use Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) in this mission, chromatography will be a central concept of the map.</p>

	After completion of this part of the missionâ€¦
		<ul><li>you can list different techniques of separation and identification of chemical substances.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>you can relate the solubility of a substance in a solvent to its migration on a static phase with this solvent as the mobile phase.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>you can identify chromatography as a separation and identification technique.</li></ul>
