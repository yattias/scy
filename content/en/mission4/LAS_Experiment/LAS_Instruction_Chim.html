<p>Now, you are going to make a real lab work!<br />
In the previous part of the mission you and your team have designed an experimental procedure. Now you are actually going to carry out your experiment in order to find the answer to the question of the attorney. You will take a picture of the end result of the experiment, upload it into SCY-Lab and annotate with an appropriate drawing tool, so that your results can also be used in court.</p>
