<h1>Results of the experiment
</h1>
<p>The result of the last step in your experiment – gel electrophoresis – is a gel with band patterns. To make your results accessible and understandable for the people in the courtroom, you will take the following steps:<br />
1. Take a picture of the outcome with a digital camera or your mobile phone.<br />
2. Upload the picture onto your computer.<br />
If you have more than one picture, repeat the process.<br />
<br />
<span class="Bold">If you don't have a camera</span>, just go to the next step "Annotation on my results" and use the tool to draw your gel before making your annotation.</p>
