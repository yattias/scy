<h1>Experiment
</h1>
<p>In the previous part of the mission you and your team have designed an experimental procedure. Now you are actually going to carry out your experiment in order to find the answer to the question of the attorney. The end result of the experiment will be a gel with band patterns. You will take a picture of this gel, upload it into SCY-Lab and annotate it, so that your results can also be used in court.</p>
