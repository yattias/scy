<h1>Official report
</h1>
<p>Write a report for the attorney. This report will be used in court, and the verdict of the judge partly depends upon it. Therefore, confine yourself to unbiased observations and reliable conclusions. Your report should at least give answers to the following questions:</p>
<li>Did the crime scene sample contain biological material?</li>
<li>Did you manage to make DNA-profiles out of the sample(s)?</li>
<li>Did you find a match between the evidence sample and any of the reference samples?</li>
<li>What information does a match between evidence and reference profile give about a suspect being guilty or not?</li>
<li>What is the profile frequency of the matching profiles? (optional)</li>
