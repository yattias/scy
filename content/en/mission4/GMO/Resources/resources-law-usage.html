<h3>Usage of GMOs</h3> 
If GM is already permitted it is the responsibility of the producer to follow later the long-term effects on humans, animals and environment. As soon as a threat occurs, the use of GMO will be stopped, its usage permission will be abolished and it will be removed from the market and usage. In addition to the manufacturer, the effects of GMOs will be monitored by several research- and monitoring agencies.
