<h3>How does marketing of GM salmon take place?</h3>
<p>Aqua Bounty, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, aims to sell GM salmon eggs to companies that would raise them in enclosed facilities such as land-based tanks. The gene-altered fish can grow to &quot;market weight&quot; of up to six kilograms (13.2 pounds) in two or three years. Natural salmon needs four years to reach the same weight. The company will sell the eggs only to people who agree to keep the fish isolated from wild salmon populations, and whose facilities have been inspected by the FDA. Raising GM salmon is profitable for fish farms. In countries where the majority of consumed salmon is imported, the fast-growing fish could help domestic salmon fisheries gain a larger share of the market and, therefore, also promote the local economy.
