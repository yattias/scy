<h3>Biotechnology, bioethics and transgenic organisms</h3>
<p>Biotechnology isn't something new - selective breeding to create more useful varieties of animals and plants is a form of biotechnology that human beings have used for thousands of years. Biotechnology includes any use of science or technology to alter the characteristics of a particular breed or animal. Biotechnology can be good or bad for animals - and it may also produce an answer to the ethical problems of experimenting on animals. Transgenic animals raise a particularly difficult problem.</p>

<p>Bioethics addresses the impact of technology on individuals and societies. Bioethical issues include an individual's right to privacy, equality of access to care, and doctor-patient confidentiality. In the case of transgenic organisms, a major bioethical issue is freedom of choice. Yet broader issues also arise, such as the ethics of interfering with nature, and effects of transgenic organisms on the environment.</p>
