<p><b>Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on GM food and feed</b> provides general framework for regulating GM food and feed in the EU. This framework pursues the global objective of ensuring a high level of protection of human life and health and welfare, environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring that the internal market works effectively.</p>

<p>The regulation determines that the placing on the market of GMOs and foodstuffs containing these, whether they are intended for consumption by humans or animals, is regulated by a specific authorization procedure.</p>
<p>This Regulation is stricter than the previous legislation. The Regulation applies to three types of product:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="1" >
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>genetically modified organisms for food and feed use;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>food and feed containing GMOs;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&bull;</td>
    <td>food and feed produced from or containing ingredients produced from GMOs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>    

<p>The Regulation does not concern food produced by means of GMOs and products produced by animals consuming GM food or treated with GM medicine.</p>

<p>The principle of this Regulation is that none of these groups of products may not be brought to the European Community market before its safety has been evaluated by the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), and the decision to permit placing on the market, has been made. In addition to a favourable opinion of the EFSA, the permit for the placing product on the market needs also approval of European Union Member States. The European Commissionâ€™s decision is binding to all Member States.</p>
