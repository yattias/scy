<h3>The procedure for admission to the market</h3>
<p>For the new food or feed use of GMOs and bringing GMO food or feed to the European Union market, an application and information required by the competent national authority, have to be submitted by the company wishing to market. The competent national authority shall forward the documents to the European Food Safety Authority, which assesses the safety of GM food or feed. If the application is submitted for growing GM crop (seed or propagating material), the European Food Safety Authority has to ask the opinion of the Member States under Directive 2001/18/EC. In other cases, EFSA may ask the opinion of the Member States under Directive 2001/18/EC.</p>
<p>Then, the European Commission will prepare a draft decision, which approval will be decided by the representatives of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health by a qualified majority. If this agreement is not reached, the draft will be sent back to the Council of Ministers, which will in turn, vote. If consensus is not reached, the draft is sent back to the European Commission who has the right to decide independently. Permission is granted for 10 years, it can be extended.
