<h3>Why is GM food developed and distributed?</h3>
<p>GM food is developed and distributed because it has some significant advantages for manufacturers and consumers. Mostly, it is expressed by the lower price of the product or higher efficiency (resistance or nutritional value) or both. There are special systems created for the thorough evaluation of GM organisms and GM food products. There is no evidence that commercial transgenic crops contain new allergens other than those in normal foods nor have a negative impact on human health.</p>
