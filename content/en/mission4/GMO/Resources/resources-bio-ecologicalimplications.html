<h3>What determines heredity of an organism and how are GMOs created?</h3>
<p>Organism’s heredity is determined by its chromosomes. There is the same number of chromosomes in every cell of an organism. But there is an exception – gametes contain half of the chromosomes. Chromosomes consist of hereditary material – DNA. DNA is a biopolymer, which monomers are four different deoxyribonucleotides: A, T, C and G. According to the nucleotide sequence of DNA, the molecules of RNA and proteins are synthesized in each cell. The fragment of DNA that determines the monomer sequence of one RNA or protein, is called a gene. As all hereditary traits of organisms are expressed as a result of RNA and proteins, we can claim that the heredity of organisms originates from the nucleotide sequence of DNA.</p>

<p>Genetically  modified organism (GMO) is a human-made organism whose chromosomes are  introduced genes from another organisms or whose DNA has been  artificially changed. As a result of this process, the genes of GMO differ from  its companions.</p>
