<h3>Moral Implications</h3>
<p>Creating transgenic farm animals is considered not only threatening to natural ecosystems, but also devastating as a form of mistreatment.  This concept centers upon the notion of species integrity, the idea that every animal, whether owned by humans or not, has a natural right to have its genetic code left intact and untouched.  This notion of integrity, though calling for a complete ban on transgenic animals, centers mostly on the use of biotechnology on agricultural animals because of the widespread threat such animals pose to natural ecosystems.</p>

<p>Apart from a complete ban on transgenic animals, the species integrity argument serves as an important consideration with regard to agricultural animals that are engineered insentient.  Because this use of biotechnology is so new, few scholarly reactions have been published in regard to it.  At minimum, such technology helps to substantiate the belief that animals are sentient, that they are conscious beings deserving not only of protection, but deep respect and thoughtful consideration.  Likewise, if such technology is eventually practiced and utilized, the culpable act of killing, or mistreatment and cruelty of animals will still exist.  Nothing will have been done to address this underlying dilemma.</p> 

<p>This is true because sentience is not the only aspect that separates animals from, say, plants or rocks.  Insentient animals, presumably, would still experience the world in a number ways beyond their judgments of pain or pleasure - by thinking, communicating, moving, seeing, touching, tasting, nurturing their young, among others.  Such animals would still demand greater consideration than plants or rocks.  Potentially, genetic engineering animals to be senseless to mistreatment might only exacerbate what is really the focus of the call for animal rights - the belief that mistreating animals is cruel, abusive and wrong and that no amount of technology or distance from the slaughterhouses can erase complicity.</p>
