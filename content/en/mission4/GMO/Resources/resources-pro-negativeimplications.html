<h3>Negative Implications of Genetic Engineering Animals</h3>
<p>While genetic engineering is quickly making an indelible mark on society, and its promise is great, there are a number of concerns about the ramifications that genetic engineering has for society and the environment.  Environmental advocates and animal rights groups are often the loudest voices in opposition.  For each solution that genetic engineering claims to solve, there are inherent risks.  In general, opponents of genetic engineering assert that such technology creates a huge diminution in the standing of animals, leaving them as nothing more than &quot;test tubes with tails,&quot; only of benefit for the exploitive practices of factory farming, and drug and organ manufacturing.  There are both real and potential risks associated with biotechnology and its manipulation of animal genetics.</p>
