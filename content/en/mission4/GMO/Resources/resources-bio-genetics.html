<h3>Does a GMO breed with natural species?</h3>
<p>Genetically modified organism (GMO) is a human-made organism whose chromosomes are introduced genes from another organism or whose DNA has been artificially changed. As a result of this process, the genes of GMO differ from its companions. Some GMOs are able to breed with natural species and some of them cannot. In order to find out, whether GMO salmon breeds with natural salmon, they have to be raised together for a while. Then we have to compare its offspring’s genes with these of a natural salmon. In this case, the DNA sequences of corresponding organisms have to be analyzed. The analysis of whole organism’s DNA is complicated, time-consuming and expensive. Thus, a considerably faster and cheaper method – a DNA restriction analysis – is mostly used, which usually gives quite accurate results. The DNA restriction is a method of gene technology, where specific restrictases are used. Restrictase is an enzyme that binds with a DNA molecule and cuts the bihelix of a DNA from a place with a certain sequence. As a result, the DNA fragments of different length are formed, because the DNA is cut into so many fragments as many cutting sites are in the DNA. If the DNA of two organisms is identical, we will get exactly the same number of fragments of the same size. Differences in the DNA sequence are reflected in the length of some fragments.</p>

<p>In order to make the DNA fragments got from restriction analysis visible, the fragments should at first be separated from each other and then DNA has to be coloured. In this way, the restriction map or profile is formed, that enables to compare DNA of different organisms. In the picture below (Figure 1) the results of DNA restriction analysis are presented. The first and last column (L) show the result of complete DNA splitting, where restrictase has not been used. Here you can see which possible fragments can be formed. For each dark stripe a fragment with certain length corresponds. Thereat, the highest stripe is the fragment with the biggest molecular weight and the fragments below it are with smaller molecular weight. For analysis it is important to compare the DNA fragments of wild (W), genetically modified (G) and offspring of W and G organism (X). By comparing the stripes you will find out whether the offspring raised together (X) contain exactly the same DNA that is in wild (W) or genetically modified organism (G). If DNA fragments of offspring contain both, fragments of natural and GMO, their crossbreeding has occurred.</p>

<p><b>Take a minute and think about it!</b></p>
<p>Now, from the figure, you can find out if GMO has crossbred with wild type organism of the same species!</p>
