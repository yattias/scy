<h3>Good luck to you on this adventure!</h3>

<p>It was a beautiful shiny spring afternoon, when a boy and a girl were walking on a street and passing by a local supermarket. The girl said: &quot;William, lets go in and buy some foodstuff! I would like to try making sushi. You know, yesterday when I was chatting with my American niece on Skype, I got a very good sushi recipe called &quot;Inside-Out Salmon Sushi Roll&quot; from her. So, let’s buy some salmon, sushi rice, avocado, nori seaweed sheets, sesame seeds and other ingredients. Then we can go to my place and make some.&quot; William thought the idea was great and they went shopping.</p>
<p>When they reached to the fish-section and started selecting suitable salmon, Kate said: &quot;Do you know what my niece also has said? She told me that in her country, after some time, a first genetically modified animal for human food – a salmon – will be available for consumption! I am personally a little bit scared of these new &quot;Frankenfoods&quot; and as far as I have heard, they are probably dangerous. There is always so much buzz around them in the news!&quot; William scratched his head, while saying: &quot;I think people should not use this scary nickname for GMOs. May be they are even better than ordinary organisms and bring benefit for the humankind? How would you know?&quot; Kate became curious: &quot;It is so strange that growing GMOs is allowed in some countries, but is not in others. Is it reasonable to grow genetically modified salmon in our country?&quot;</p>
