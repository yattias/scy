Write here your previously composed <b>revised field-specific decision</b>. Then read critically through the decisions of all fields and hold an argued conversation about the pros and cons of the distinct experts’ arguments. Based on the conversation, one member of your council makes changes on the ELO <b>Expert council’s decision</b> and finalizes it. Keep in mind, that the final solution should include arguments of different experts (biologists, economists, animal protectors and jurists).
