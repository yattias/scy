<p><strong>03: Glucose level simulation</strong> <br />
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the 'empty' graph on your right. Behind this graph is a model which allows you to simulate what happens to someone's blood glucose levels under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Below the graph you see a couple of buttons and sliders. With the buttons you can indicate whether someone takes in glucose (i.e. consumes energy drink) or not, and whether someone is going to exercise or not. With the sliders you can set the start time and duration of the  exercise.</p>
<p>Once you have made your settings, click on the 'Start' button and see what happens. The red line represents the blood glucose concentration. The black line indicates the period of exercise.</p>
<p>First you can play around a bit with the simulation. Then perform the experiments that will help you answer your research questions. You can perform as many experiments as you like.</p>
