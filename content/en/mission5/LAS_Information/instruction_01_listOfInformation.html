<p>
In the assignment you will find several important terms that have to do with glucose in your body. Have a look at the resources (see the resource drawer below) and explain every term in your own words. You can use SCYLighter (to be downloaded here: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/scylighter/" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/scylighter/</a>) to select relevant texts on the webpages that you visit.</p>
