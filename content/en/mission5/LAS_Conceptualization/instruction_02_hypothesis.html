<p><strong>02: Hypothesis</strong> <br /></p>
<p>As you have learned, glucose plays a central role in your body. 
Glucose is the main source of energy for all your cells.
The glucose concentration in your blood remains relatively constant under normal circumstances. 
But higher levels of glucose in your blood may have a positive effect on your performance during exercise and increase your power of endurance. 
This assignment consists of two parts.</p>
<p><strong>A. Make your predictions...</strong></p>
<p>Consider the four situations described in the window on the right. Predict what will happen with the blood glucose concentration in each situation, and remove the words that do not apply (i.e. choose 'rise', 'lower' or 'remain the same' and remove the other two).</p>
<p><strong>B. Write your hypotheses...</strong></p>
<p>Now read the following research questions carefully:</p>
<p><i>What are the effects of glucose ingestion on blood glucose concentration?</i></p>
<p><i>What are the effects of exercise on blood glucose concentration?</i></p>
<p>Perhaps you already have expectations about the answer to these research questions. Such an expectation is your hypothesis. 
Formulate a hypothesis for each of the two research questions (in the window on the right).</p>
