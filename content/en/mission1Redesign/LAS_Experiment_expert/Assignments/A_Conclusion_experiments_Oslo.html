<p>The outcome of your experiments must now be compared with the research question that were formulated. Looking at the information, try to draw conclusions for each of your research questions.</p>
<p>If your informationis of high quality, you can move on to other research questions. Sometimes, your new insight will also give rise to new research questions.</p>
<p>In addition to writing your conclusions down in regular text, you must also use the knowledge you have gained to build, or extend, your expert concept-map.</p>
