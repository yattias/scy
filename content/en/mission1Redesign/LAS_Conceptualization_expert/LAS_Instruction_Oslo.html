<h1>Becoming an expert
</h1>
<p>You have been assigned a specific expert role: <br/>expert on energy sources, expert on heat pumps, expert on solar panels and solar thermal collectors, or  expert on heat loss and insulation. <br/>So now it is time for you to become a 'true' expert in your field. But how do you become an expert? How do you ‘build’ knowledge? <br/>The steps that you will follow in the process of becoming an expert are depicted in the diagram below.</p>

<p>Following these steps, your expert group builds up a lot of knowledge on certain aspects of CO2-friendly building. <br/>Later on, each of you will be using this knowledge for the benefit of your own design group. <br/>But for now you have to operate as a team. It might be wise to divide tasks between the members of your expert group. <br/>But by the end of the expert phase, all findings must have been shared, so that each member has acquired more or less the same knowledge and skills.</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>It is often a good idea to start with a little bit of background reading on your subject. <br/>After you have become acquainted with the most important terms and concepts in your field of knowledge, it is time to formulate a couple of research questions. <br/>Then you browse for information that is specific for your research questions. You have to critically examine and compare the information you gather so that you know <br/>it holds scientific standard. When you have information of good standard that answer your research question you can draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Note that this circle is often considered as a 'spiral'. When you have new information it is not uncommon to go back and refine your initial research question <br/>and then try to answer the new research questions.</p>
