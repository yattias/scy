<title>My concept map on CO2 emission</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>A concept map is a  graphical representation of important concepts (in boxes), and the relations  between those concepts (represented by arrows or lines with a label). This may  sound complicated, but if you take a look at the example on the following page,  it will become clear what the main idea of a concept map is.</p>
<h2>What do I have to do?</h2>
<p>- A beginning of the concept-map is already given.<br />
- You have to add 10 other concepts at least.<br />
- Each concept has to be connected with at least one  other concept with an arrow.<br />
- Each connection  (relation) has to be defined. Useful labels are for instance ‘is’, ‘causes’,  ‘produces’ and ‘used for’.
