<p> The purpose of this tool is to the let you work with 2D and 3D geometrical shapes.</p>
<p>To use this tool you drag an object from the panel to the left into the work area. Then you use the calculator to calculate the surface area of 2D objects or the empty parameters for 3D objects. When calculation of an object is done you can add or subtract from the computation sheet on the lower right. The scratch pad below the work area can be used for intermediate calculation. 
</p>
<p>To help you using the calculator and to use specific formulas there are one notation guide and one formula guide available in the calculator panel or in the help menu. When you use the formula guide you can copy and paste the formula into the scratch pad to do your intermediate calculation.</p>
<p>If you want to delete an object from the work area you simply click the object you want to delete and then click the dust bin in the left hand corner. Note that after deleting it you cannot undo.
