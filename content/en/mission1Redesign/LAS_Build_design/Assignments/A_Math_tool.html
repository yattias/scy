<p>With this tool you are going to work with geometrical calculations relevant for house design. Working with this tool you will get two main tasks: 
<br/><br/>
1. Explain how the surface area to volume ratio changes with the size and shape of a specific 3 dimensional object:
<ul>
<li>Choose the 3D tab.</li>
<li>Calculate the empty parameters of one big and one small sphere. Add your results to the computation sheet by pressing 'Add'.</li>
<li>Calculate the empty parameters of one big and one small rectangular prism. Add your results to the computation sheet by pressing 'Add'.</li>
<li>Sort the computation sheet ascending according to sa/v - ratio</li>
<li>Reflect on the following: Which object has the least ratio and which has the highest? What does this mean when designing a house in terms of heat loss?</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
2. Design the ground floor of your house:
<ul>
<li>Choose the 2D tab</li>
<li>Create a ground floor with a surface area 120 square meters by using at least one triangle, one rectangle and one circle.</li>
<li>Use the calculator to calculate the surface area for each shape and the summarize them in the computation sheet on the right.</li>
<li>Use the drawing of the ground floor to construct a drawing of your house in Google Sketchup. You can export your ground floor by clicking the house image in the top left corner.</li>
</ul>
