<h1>Design your own CO2-friendly house
</h1>
<p>After each member of your group has become an expert in a particular field of knowledge, It is now time to actually start designing your own CO-2-friendly house. Each member of your design group has become an expert in a particular field of knowledge. You have shared these differents kinds of expertise and made decisions on the basis of this shared knowledge for the design of your CO-2 friendly house. So nearly all preparations have been done, and the 'real' design work can begin! </p>
<p>In this activity you will first do some geometrical tasks. What you are going to do is to work on surface areas and volumes for different 3 dimensional geometrical shapes. Then we want you to create the ground floor of your house using different 2 dimensional geometrical shapes. When the latter task is done you can export an image of this ground floor to Google Sketchup where you finalize a 3 dimensional drawing of your house. Make sure that your design is consistent with the choices you have made before! </p>
