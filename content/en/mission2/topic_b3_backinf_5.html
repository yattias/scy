<h1 class="mainTitle">Transfer of energy and matter</h1>
<p>There is transfer of both energy and matter through the various compounds of ecosystems.  However, there is a crucial difference between the way energy and matter move through ecosystem compounds. The flow of energy proceed in a linear fashion: energy is continuously supplied by the sun and enters in food webs through photosynthesis. Then energy moves from the producers (i.e., plants) to all other consumers until it is totally degraded through trophic levels. On the other hand, matter moves in a cyclical manner: matter is always recycled through the activity of decomposers.</p>
