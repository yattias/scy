<h1>Making experimental procedure (game simulation)</h1>
<p>Before conducting the game simulation, you need to describe the various actions you are going to perform in order to run your experiment. The sequence of the steps you are going to follow is called experimental procedure. The description of the experimental procedure should be detailed. Another person should have enough guidance to run the same experiment by following the same procedure. You will use the Experimental Design Tool in SCY-Lab. The Tool will request your research questions and hypotheses, which you have already formulated. Then, you will describe the general principle of your experiment, where you will need to specify the variables you will examine during the experiment. Note that you have to specify your dependent variable (i.e., the parameter, which corresponds to the observed result of the experiment) and one or more independent variables (i.e., parameters you will manipulate in order to observe their impact on the dependent variable). For example, we can investigate the impact of various quantities of water, which will be supplied to a plant (independent variable: water supply measured in litres) to the development of the plant measured in terms of plant height (dependent variable: plant height measured in centimetres).</p>
<p>Organize your actions in subsequent steps. Each step will include a number of actions. Note that, if you have more than one independent variable, you should change only one of them at a time, so that the observed impact on the dependent variable can be attributed to that independent variable. While defining your questions, hypotheses, principles, steps, and actions, you can add any comment you believe must be made so that the experimental procedure will be intelligible.</p>
<h3>Now you have to plan your experimental procedure.</h3>
<p>This is a special tool that supports you in this process. First open your hypotheses and copy the content to the hypotheses field of your experimetal procedure. If your previously formulated research questions and hypotheses are not discoverable with the tools and equipment available, please revise these and write your updated research questions and hypotheses to the Experimental procedure ELO. Here you may also search for the ELOs of your buddies in order to develop your own Experimental procedure. You can also read some <a href="guidelines_ep.html">guidelines</a> for planning experiments.</p>
