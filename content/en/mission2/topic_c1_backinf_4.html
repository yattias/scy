<h1 class="mainTitle">Water hardness</h1>
<p>Water hardness is defined as the reluctance of water to produce lather with soap, due to various dissolved salts, mainly salts of calcium and magnesium. Rainwater is soft and does not containing any minerals, but as it seeps through ground containing chalk or limestone, it is enriched with chemical compounds.</p> 
<p>While playing a very important role in water bodies, these same salts cause unpleasant scale in boilers, pipes and kettles.</p>
