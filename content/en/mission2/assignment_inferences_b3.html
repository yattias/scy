<p>Inferences can be generated on the basis of what you observed by using the SCYDynamics model. You can rely on either a data table or a graph. The structure of a good inference is the same as that of a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Often the experiment sets some limitations for interpreting the results and making inferences. Please think about your modelling experiment and describe what limitations need to be taken into account in relation to your inferences, i.e., are they valid only in the case of certain species, etc.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for making inferences:</h3>
<ul><li>An inference is a clear and concise answer to a research question derived from data analysis.</li></ul>
<ul><li>•	The structure of an inference is similar to the structure of a hypothesis: it specifies dependent and independent variables and describes how a dependent variable is influenced by an independent variable (see the <a href="guidelines_h.html" target="_moreResources">guidelines</a> for formulating hypotheses).</li></ul>
<p>Many inferences are phrased as ‘if … , then … ’ statements.</p>
