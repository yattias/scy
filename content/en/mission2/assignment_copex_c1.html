<p>Plan your experiment. To do this, look at your previously completed 'Hypotheses' ELO and select only one research question and corresponding hypothesis. Consider the available equipment and the importance of the research question in solving the problem you initially formulated.</p>
<p>The selected research question and hypothesis can be copied from one ELO to another. If necessary, clarify them.</p>
<p>The experiment can be done either in a group or individually (follow your teacher’s guidelines). If you are conducting the experiment in a group, then you can search for your group members’ research questions and hypotheses and start collaborating on developing one experimental procedure for the whole group. To do this, drag the icon of your buddy (or the icons of all of your buddies) to the icon bar of the ELO and select 'Send the ELO’. Before that, you should develop your own experimental procedure that will can be then discussed with your buddy through chat.</p>
