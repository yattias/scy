<h1 class="mainTitle">Food sources of organisms</h1>
<p>Organisms in an ecosystem are distinguished on the basis of their food sources. The source of all food is ultimately photosynthesis, through which plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into organic compounds (e.g., sugars) and oxygen (O2). Plants use these organic compounds for food. Since plants produce their food themselves, they are called ‘producers’ or ‘autotrophs’. On the contrary, all animals are ‘heterotrophs’. Animals which eat plants are called ‘herbivores’ or ‘primary consumers’. Animals which feed on other animals are called ‘carnivores’ or ‘secondary consumers’. Each relationship that involves an herbivore (prey) and a carnivore (predator) is termed a prey-predator relationship. Some carnivores predate on other carnivores. These predators are called ‘tertiary consumers’.</p>

<h1 class="mainTitle">Food chains and food webs</h1>
<p>Because organisms are dependent upon other organisms for their food, we can construct ‘food chains’ by tracking the feeding habits of various organisms. Each food chain has a plant species, alga, or autotrophic bacteria at its starting point. However, most species do not feed on one specific feeding source, but on a range of feeding sources. Further, feeding sources might vary according to the season. In order to describe this variety, scientists use the term ‘food web’, which comprises ensembles of interconnected food chains.</p>

<h1 class="mainTitle">Trophic levels</h1>
<p>Collections of organisms which present the same feeding habits correspond to trophic levels. Putting one trophic level upon another yields an ecological pyramid. By looking at any ecological pyramid, we can easily see that the size of subsequent trophic levels decreases steadily from the bottom to the top of the pyramid. Energy transferred to the next trophic level is always less than the energy introduced in the former trophic level. Organisms need to expend energy to stay alive, undertake all their activities, and reproduce. It has been calculated that only about 10% of the energy stored in each trophic level is transferred to the next trophic level.</p>

<h1 class="mainTitle">Decomposers</h1>
<p>A group of organisms that are not depicted in ecological pyramids are the ‘decomposers’ or ‘detritivores’. They break down dead plant and animal tissues (i.e., detritus), and gain the energy included in the dead organic material. Examples of decomposers are bacteria and fungi (e.g., mushrooms). By deconstructing dead animals and plants, decomposers transform dead organic matter into inorganic chemicals, many of which are used again by plants as mineral nutrients. Note that these mineral nutrients do not comprise ‘food’ for plants in the meaning of ‘energy’. They are just essential elements that plants need to integrate in the organic compounds they produce through photosynthesis.</p>

<h1 class="mainTitle">Transfer of energy and matter</h1>
<p>There is transfer of both energy and matter in ecosystems. However, there is a crucial difference. The flow of energy proceeds in a linear fashion: energy is continuously supplied by the sun and moves from the producers (i.e., plants) to all other consumers until it is completely used and degraded to warmth. On the other hand, matter moves in a cyclical manner: matter is always recycled through the activity of decomposers.</p>
