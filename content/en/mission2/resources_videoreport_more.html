<h1>Windows Movie Maker manual</h1>
<p>Windows Movie Maker is fairly easy to use.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Open</b> WMM (or download it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/moviemaker2.mspx" target="_external">Microsoft</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>First, you need to <b>import</b> all the video material to your computer. In WMM, you can choose between two menus: Tasks and Collections. Choose the Tasks menu. Click ‘Capture from video device’. (If your video material is already on your computer, click ‘Import video’.) WMM will ask you to give your video a name. In the window comes up next you can alter some basic settings (resolution, etc.), but the default settings are generally okay. Then you can start actually capturing your video clips: just start your camera in playback mode and click ‘Start Capture’ to begin transferring the material onto your computer. When the transfer is done, click ‘Stop Capture’ and ‘Finish’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>The video material you have imported will now be visible in WMM’s Collections window. WMM will cut your video material into <b>shorter clips</b> if you right-click on the video icon and choose ‘Create Clips’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>At the bottom	 of the window you will see either a Storyboard or a Timeline. This is where you actually compose your video from individual clips. Simply <b>drag</b> the clips to the Storyboard, according to the sequence in your initial story board.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You probably don’t want to use all of your clips from beginning to end. Some material might not be suitable (e.g. shaky images) or a clip may simply be too long. You can <b>trim</b> a clip by selecting it, and playing the clip in the Preview Monitor (on the right side of the window) to the exact point where you want to cut it. Click the ‘Split Clip’ button in the Preview Monitor. You will see in the Storyboard (or Timeline) that the original clip is now divided into two sections. Delete the section of the clip that you do not want to use.</li>
  <li>Under ‘2. Edit Movie’ you can select <b>special features</b> such as titles, video-effects and transitions between clips.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Click ‘Save to my computer’ (under ‘3. Finish Video’) and WMM will make your compilation of clips (including titles, transitions, etc.) into <b>one (final) movie</b>.
</li>
</ul>
