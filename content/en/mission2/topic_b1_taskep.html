<h1>Experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Before you actually start performing your experiments, you have to describe what you plan to do. In other words, you have to write an <a href="guidelines_ep.html">experimental procedure</a>. An experimental procedure is usually composed of a list of tasks that have to be carried out. Since you are not going to perform any real experiments, the instructions in your experimental procedure do not mention any materials. However, you still have to provide details on the steps that you will undertake. An example of such a step could be: &quot;run the model with five different values for nitrate (10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 μmol/l) and a fixed value of phosphate (10 μmol/l), and save the datasets&quot;.</p>
<p>1. Use this tool to plan your experimental procedure. First open your hypotheses and copy the content to the hypotheses field of your experimental procedure. If your previously formulated research questions and hypotheses cannot be answered with the dynamic model, you can of course formulate additional questions and hypotheses.</p>
<p>2. Then make a detailed list of tasks that you will perform.</p>
