<p>Formulate the main problem present in this situation in your own words.</p>

<p>It should be based on the video you already watched (or a transcript of it). If you have not already watched it, you can read the story <a href="topic_b2_problem.html" target="_moreAssignment">here.</a></p>

<p>You should distinguish the abiotic and biotic components of the ecosystem described by Otto and Silvia.  You will also think what happens to an ecosystem when a disaster, a massive oil spill, occurs. You should also do some additional background reading.</p>
