<p>Welcome to the ECO mission. You will learn how several factors affect an ecosystem â€“ a freshwater water body. SCY-Lab will provide most of the guidance for your work. However, ask your teacher for help when necessary. For example, your teacher should tell you the order in which to do the four inquiry topics in this mission.</p>
<p>This is where you can see the <a href="challenge_eco.html" target="_moreResources"><b>challenge</b></a> you are face in this mission. Please click on the link and read the information carefully in order to learn what this mission is about.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="80%">Your first task in this mission is to draw a concept map based on your initial knowledge. This should be revised after completing each of the inquiry cycles. To do this, open the mission map and move to the <b>Concept map</b> space.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="80%">Then look through the task for making video report and decide when to complete it (click on the <b>Video report</b> icon in the mission map). Ask your teacher when it should be completed.</td>
