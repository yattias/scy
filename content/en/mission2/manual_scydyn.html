<h1>SCYDynamics</h1>
<p>SCYDynamics is a modelling environment. It can be used to create abstract, mathematical models of real-world phenomena, either simple or complex. Once you have created a model, SCYDynamics will do all the calculations for you. So SCYDynamics will let you study processes and relations between variables, without having to do the mathematical work yourself.</p>
<p>Take a look at the SCYDynamics tool. The workspace in the middle is where you can find the model (or build your own model). Any SCYDynamics model is built from the following symbols:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" >
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Rectangles. The rectangles are called ‘stocks’ and represent a quantity which may decrease or increase over time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Straight arrows (with two small triangles). These arrows are called ‘flows’ and are used to add or subtract the change over time from stocks. Flows are either connected to another stock or to a cloud.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Diamonds. These are called ‘constants’ and they represent a fixed value.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Circles. The circles are called ‘auxiliaries’ and they are used to calculate values, and feed them into flows (or other auxiliaries). The auxiliaries are defined by a certain equation (formula).</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Small arrows. These are called ‘relations’. They are used to make the values of constants and stocks known to auxiliaries, and – vice versa – feed the result of the calculations of an auxiliary into flows (or other auxiliaries).</td>
   </tr>   
</table>

<p>Probably this sounds a bit abstract. To make things more concrete, let’s take a look at the <b>introductory model for scydynamics</b>.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" >
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>The stock in this model is called ‘population’. Let’s assume that the quantity of the stock represents the size of a population of fish (at a certain time). If you double-click on the stock symbol, you can view it’s settings. As you can see, the start value is 1000. In other words, we start our simulation with 1000 fish.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>When new fish are born, the population size increases (which can be inferred from the flow going into the stock at the left side). Double-clicking on the constant ‘birth rate’ reveals a value of 0.2. If you click on the auxiliary ‘births’ you will understand what actually happens. Each time-step, the population size is multiplied by 0.2. The outcome of this calculation is then added to the original population.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>When fish die, the population size decreases. Double-clicking on the constant ‘death rate’ reveals a value of 0.1. So, each time-step the population size is multiplied by 0.1. The outcome of this calculation is then subtracted from the original population. In other words, 10 percent of the population dies each time-step.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Now it is time to see the model in action. At the top of the window you see three tabs: editor, graph and table. Until now you have been working in the editor tab. You can use the other tabs to run the model and to make the results visible.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" >
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Go to the tab ‘graph’.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>In the left upper corner you can select which variables you want to make visible. Select ‘population’.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>The start time is set at 0.0. Set the stop time at 10.0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Click ‘run simulation’. You see a graph appear at the right side. Apparently, the population increases exponentially over time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">&bull;</td>
      <td>Go back to the ‘editor’ tab, and change the birth rate and the death rate. Run the model again and see what the effect of your changes are.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
