<h1>Guidelines: Hypothesis</h1>
<ul><li>A hypothesis is a clear and concise statement which expresses the expected answer to a question.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A hypothesis has to be testable.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A hypothesis does not have to be correct;
if your hypothesis turns out to be false, that doesn’t mean your research was not successful.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many hypotheses are phrased as ‘if … , then …’ statements.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Examples of good hypotheses are:</h3>
<ul><li>If the nitrate concentration increases, the rate of primary production will increase.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If the phosphate concentration increases, the rate of primary production will increase.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Producers need higher amounts of nitrogen than phosphate.</li></ul>
