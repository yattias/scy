<h1>Research questions</h1>
<p>You have become familiar with the most important concepts and factors that are involved in the problem of the algae-filled lakes. 
Now you are going to use the dynamic model you have already seen to find out more about the relations between these factors. 
So instead of doing a real experiment, you will perform a virtual experiment. 
But first you have to formulate a couple of <a href="guidelines_q.html">research questions</a>.
At this stage, formulate (at least) two research questions. </p>
<p>[It is possible that one of your questions cannot be answered by studying the dynamic model. This is not a problem. 
Additional questions can be formulated later on.]</p>
