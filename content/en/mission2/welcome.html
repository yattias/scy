<h1>Welcome to SCY-Lab!</h1>
  <p>During the mission, you will work on multiple Emerging  Learning Objects (ELOs). The ELOs that you are to be working at the moment, are aligned  on top of your screen.</p>
  <p>Each ELO has four different  drawers on the left side.</p>
    <ul><li>The first drawer contains  assignments and guidelines related to the ELO.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The second drawer contains  different information resources that help you to create the ELOs (e.g. texts of  theory, web-sites for additional information, etc).</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The third drawer is for asking  feedback on your ELO.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The forth drawer is for tagging.  Here you can create a tag for the ELO and agree or disagree with existing tags.</li></ul>
<p>In the four corners of SCY-Lab,  you can see specific SCY-services you will need throughout the mission.</p>
    <ul><li>On the top left corner you can  select buddies to collaborate on a specific ELO. To invite a buddy for  collaborating on an ELO, just drag and drop the icon of the buddy to the respective ELO.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>On the lower left corner you  can create new ELOs, search for existing ELOs and remove unnecessary ELOs from desktop.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>On the top right corner, there  are Feedback buttons for asking and providing feedback, and the e-Portfolio  button that enables you to navigate to your online portfolio.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>On the lower right corner you  can see the mission map icon. When you click on it, the mission map  will open. In the mission map, there are a number of icons that represent different  parts of the mission (these parts are also called &quot;spaces&quot;). Clicking on an icon opens  up the respective space. When you have finished working in one space, you can  re-open the mission map and move to the next space. This is how you can  navigate through the mission.</li></ul>
<p>In each part of the mission, you  will work on some ELOs. When entering a space for the first time, the special window - &quot;curtain&quot; - appears. The curtain provides some  basic instructions about what you have to do in each part of the mission. If you have read the instructions, you  can close the curtain . The curtain can be re-opened  by clicking the button on the top center of the screen.</p>
<p>In each space, you will always find a glossary that  explains the central concepts you will need to understand for accomplishing the  mission.</p>
