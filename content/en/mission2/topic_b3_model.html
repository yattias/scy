<h1>Description of the SCY Dynamics model</h1>
<p>In the model interface, you can find a visual representation of the prey-predator relationship. Stocks stand for the prey and predator populations, respectively. The prey population is assumed to grow (inflow arrow) according to a rate, which is analogous to the product of its population size and the natural growth factor of the species. The prey population decreases according to a rate, which depends on the prey population size, the predator population size, and the ability of the predator individuals to catch and feed on prey individuals. In a few words, the change in the size of the prey population is derived by its own growth minus the rate, at which it is preyed upon by the predator. The predator population growths according to a rate, which is proportionate to its population size, to the population size of the prey population, and to the ability of the predator population to convert the prey biomass consumed into predator biomass. The predator population decreases according to a rate which is analogous to its population size and the natural death coefficient of the species. Thus, the change in the predator population can be explained as growth due to predation, minus natural death. You can plan simulations using this model by changing the values of the parameters (double-click on the variables). Then, you can observe the result of the simulation in the graph or table interface of SCYDynamics.</p>
<p>Note that you have to choose the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integration method to display the graph.</p>
