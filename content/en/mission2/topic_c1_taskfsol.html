<h1>Formulating a solution for the topic-specific problem</h1>
<p>You have already concluded the experimental procedure and addressed your hypotheses. Now you can formulate a solution to the problem you have defined at the beginning of the procedure. Go back to the problem and try to explain the situation based on the result of the experimental procedure.</p>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>The reason, why acid rain causes a vast decline of pH value in water bodies of some countries while having no similar effect in others, lies in different composition of ground. In countries with granite bedrock, acid rain causes acidification of water bodies. In other countries with ground containing limestone, acid rain doesnâ€™t lower pH of water because of neutralizing effect of calcium carbonate in limestone.</p>
<p>Now it is time to make your conclusions and to solve the problem. There might help you some <a href="guidelines_sp.html">guidelines</a>.</p>
