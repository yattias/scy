<p>Formulate the main problem presented in this situation in your own words.</p>
<p>It should be based on the story you have already read. If you have not already read it, read it <a href="topic_c1_problem.html" target="_moreAssignment">here</a>.</p>
<p>You have read the story about Otto and Anna. They are puzzled about why acid rain does not have the same effect on aquatic life in Estonia as it does in Sweden. Acidification of water bodies due to acid rain has been linked to disappearance of fish not only in Sweden, but also in Norway and Scotland. But there was no evidence of such an impact further south in Europe, although input of acid rain is higher there than in Scandinavia. Your task is to find out why acid rain raises the acidity of water in some countries, whereas in other countries the pH of water bodies remains stable despite acid rain. First, you should do some additional background reading.</p>
