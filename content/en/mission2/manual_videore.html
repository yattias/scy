    You can use any type of camera and any kind of editing software for making your video report. Once your video is finished, you will upload your video to YouTube, and then put a link to your video in SCYLab.
<p><b>Recording your video</b></p>
	See the manual for your camera for instructions.
	<p><b>Editing your video</b></p>
	There are many different programmes you can use to edit your video. One common, easy-to-use programme is Windows Movie Maker. Some basic instructions for using Windows Movie Maker are given <a href="manual_wmm.html">here</a>.
	<p><b>Uploading your video to YouTube</b></p>
	Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_external">www.youtube.com</a>. To upload your video you need a YouTube account. If you don’t have one, click ‘Create account’ in the upper part of the window. Once you are logged in, click ‘Upload’. On the page that follows you can browse to the video you want to upload, give the video a title and set some preferences. Important: enter ‘SCY ECO Mission’ in the Tags field. This way, you (and others) will be able to find your video once it has been uploaded.
<p><b>Adding a link in SCYLab</b></p>
