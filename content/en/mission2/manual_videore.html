	<h1 class="mainTitle">Video report manual</h1>
    You can use any type of camera, and any kind of editing software, during the process of making your video report. Once your video is finished, you will upload your video to YouTube, and then place a link to your video in SCYLab.
<p><b>Shooting your video</b></p>
	See the manual of your camera for instructions.
	<p><b>Editing your video</b></p>
	There are many different programmes you can use to edit your video. One common, easy-to-use programme is Windows Movie Maker. Some basic instructions for Windows Movie Maker are given <a href="manual_wmm.html">here</a>.
	<p><b>Uploading your video to YouTube</b></p>
	Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_external">www.youtube.com</a>. To upload your video you need a YouTube account. If you don’t already have an account, click ‘Create account’ in the upper part of the window. Once you are logged in, click ‘Upload’ and the yellow button ‘Upload Video’. On the following page you can browse to the video you want to upload, give the video a title and set some preferences. Important: enter “SCY ECO Mission” in the Tags field. This way, you (and others) will be able to find your video once it has been uploaded.
<p><b>Placing a link in SCYLab</b></p>
<p>Copy the YouTube link to your video into the Video report ELO.</p>
