	<h1 class="mainTitle">Video report</h1>
    <p>Throughout this mission you are going to perform one or several experiments that have something to do with aquatic ecosystems. Instead of writing a traditional, written report on paper about these experiments, you are going to record a video report. In this video report you will focus on one particular experiment you have conducted. In this video report you will explain to your audience (i.e. the rest of the class, friends, family) what experiment you have done, and what the results were.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Form a group of four students.</li>
      </ul>
     <ul> 
      <li>Decide what experiment from which topic will be the focus of your video.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>Your video must have the following chapters:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Introduction of the problem</b></li>Explain the particular situation or the problem that was the starting point of your research. Provide some general background information when necessary.
          <li><b>Research questions and hypotheses</b></li>Cleary state your research questions and hypotheses.
          <li><b>Experimental procedure</b></li>Describe the experiment you have performed. You can film the actual experimental set-up in the classroom or science lab, or show the computer model you have been working on.
          <li><b>Results of your experiment</b></li>Briefly discuss the results of your experiments. You can also incorporate video stills of the graphs and figures you have created.
          <li><b>Conclusions</b></li>Briefly discuss the main conclusions of your investigations. Also make some references to the general problem that was mentioned in the introduction.
        </ol>
      </li>
</ul>   
    <ul>
      	<li>The total duration of your video must not exceed 5 minutes.</li>
     </ul>
    <ul>
     	<li>When you are writing a report, you probably spend some time formulating your sentences and thinking about what particular information has to be in the report, and what can be left out. You will do the same here. So instead of just starting to film out of the blue, you will write a very simple storyboard for each particular scene that you want to shoot. This storyboard should at least contain some important keywords that you can use as anchors while filming. It is often a good idea to discuss your storyboards with your teacher.</li>
      </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>A final note on assessment: the main goal of the video report is to inform your audience on the work you have done. It is of course permitted to use your creativity and sense of humour, but not at the expense of the informative aspects of the video.</li>
    </ul>
