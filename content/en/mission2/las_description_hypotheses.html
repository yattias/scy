<p>Now you are in the beginning of your inquiry cycle. First, <a href="topic_b1_problem.html">read</a> the problem presentation. According to that story, you have to compose three different ELOs:</p>
<p>1. Problem formulation</p>
<p>2. Research questions</p>
<p>3. Hypotheses</p>
<p>Each of the three ELOs contains guidelines that help you in completing the tasks. You can also find here texts of theory, glossary and list of web-pages for additional information. When you have formulated the last ELO – hypotheses, you can open the mission map and move next to the “Inferences” space.</p>
