<h1>Guidelines for designing an experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Here are some guidelines that might help you to make your experimental procedure:</p>
<ul><li>The list of tasks is complete. All parameters and materials are specified.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The list of tasks is structured in such a way that it is easy to understand. Tasks could be organized in steps and sub-steps.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The variables described in the research question(s) correspond with the parameters that will be changed during the experiment.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Only one variable will be changed at a time.</li></ul>
