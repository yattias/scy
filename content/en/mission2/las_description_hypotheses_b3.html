<p>Now you are in the beginning of your inquiry cycle. First, <a href="topic_b3_problem.html">read</a> the problem presentation. According to that story, you have to compose three different ELOs:</p>
<p>1. Problem formulation</p>
<p>2. Research questions</p>
<p>3. Hypotheses</p>
<p>Each of the three ELOs contains guidelines that help you in completing the tasks. You can also find here texts of theory, glossary and list of web-pages for additional information. When you have formulated the last ELO – hypotheses, you can open the mission map and move next to the “Inferences” space.</p>

	After successfully completing the assignments, you are able to act as a researcher and:
    <ul>
	  <li>identify problems from a narrative based on a everyday situation;</li>
	  <li>search and analyse critically background information;</li>
	  <li>formulate your research questions;</li>
  	  <li>pose hypotheses that contain dependent and independent variables;</li>
	  <li>identify different trophic levels of an aquatic ecosystem;</li>
  	  <li>explain the basic types of interactions between species (predation, competition, mutualism).</li>
	</ul>
