    <h1>Mathematical model</h1>
    <p>The simple model has one stock: biomass (phytoplankton growth). Biomass increase depends on nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) concentrations. Change in phytoplankton biomass B can be described as a function of growth (µ) and mortality (m) as:</p>

    <p>Where µ (effective growth rate) is defined as:</p>
    <img src="pictures/image071.png" alt="Effective groth rate"/>
    <p>Where [PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>] and [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] denote concentrations of phosphate and nitrate in the water, and HPO<sub>4</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> are the half-saturation constants for phosphate and nitrate respectively. The half-saturation constant is an indication for the affinity of a phytoplankton species for a resource. A lower half-saturation constant indicates a higher affinity. This affinity depends, among others, on the amount of resourced needed for growth. Because phytoplankton cells contain ~16 times less P than N (according to the famous Redfield ratio), the half-saturation constant for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is typically lower than for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Also, biomass decreases at a constant (mortality) rate. Values that could be used:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>m: 	0.59 	d<sup>-1</sup></p>
    <p>µmax:	1.35	d<sup>-1</sup></p>
    <p>HPO<sub>4</sub>: 	0.2 	µmol L<sup>-1</sup></p>
    <p>HNO<sub>3</sub>: 	5.6 	µmol L<sup>-1</sup></p>
</blockquote>
        
    <h1>SCYDynamics model</h1>
    <p>In this simple SCYDynamics model students can tweak the nitrate and phosphate concentrations (denoted as constants N and P). The affinity values and the maximum growth rate are biological constants that should not be changed. The model will behave as follows. When the concentration of a resource is higher than the half-saturation constant, the growth approaches µmax, whereas if the concentration of a resource is lower than the half-saturation constant, growth approaches 0. In this simple model, growth is always exponential. Thus, nitrate and phosphate concentrations influence the growth speed.</p>
