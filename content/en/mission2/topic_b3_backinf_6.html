<h1 class="mainTitle">Aquatic ecosystems</h1>
<h3>Marine and freshwater ecosystems</h3>
<p>Aquatic ecosystems cover over two-thirds of the earth’s surface. Marine and freshwater ecosystems are the major types of aquatic ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems cover less than 1% of the earth’s surface, but still host a great variety of life forms. Indeed, freshwater ecosystems include about 40% of all fish species.</p>

<h3>Roaches and pikes</h3>
<p>Roaches and pikes are typical representatives of a prey-predator relationship in freshwater ecosystems. The common roach <i>(Rutilus rutilus)</i> is a freshwater fish native to most parts of Europe. The roach typically reaches no more than about 35 cm in length. It feeds on plant material, bottom-dwelling (benthic) invertebrates and plankton. The northern pike <i>(Esox lucius)</i> is a species of carnivorous fish, which is typical of freshwaters of the northern hemisphere. Pikes might grow to more than one meter in length and more than 20 kg in weight. They feed on smaller fish.</p>

<h3>Trophic levels in freshwater ecosystems</h3>
<p>Algae are typical representatives of autotrophic organisms in freshwater ecosystems. In stream food webs, food chains are based on algae. Most invertebrates are herbivores or detritivores. Fish are top predators. Birds and amphibians are also included among higher consumers in many cases. Many fish feed on stream invertebrates.</p>

<h3>Phytoplankton and zooplankton</h3>
<p>Phytoplankton, primarily algae, comprise the base of a lake's food chain. Zooplankton feed on algae. If one can see clearly through the water of the lake, then zooplankton have consumed much of the algae. If the water of the lake is not clear, then algae are much more abundant.</p>
