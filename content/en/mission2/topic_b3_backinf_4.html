<h1>Decomposers</h1>
<p>A group of organisms which are not depicted in ecological pyramids are the ‘decomposers’ or ‘detritivores’. They break down dead organic material (i.e., detritus), namely, dead plant and animal tissues, and gain the energy included in the dead organic material. Examples of decomposers are bacteria and fungi (e.g., mushrooms). By deconstructing dead animals and plants, decomposers transform dead organic matter into inorganic chemicals, many of which are used again by plants as mineral nutrients. Note that these mineral nutrients do not comprise ‘food’ for plants but only essential elements that plants need to uptake and integrate in the organic compounds they produce through the process of photosynthesis.</p>
