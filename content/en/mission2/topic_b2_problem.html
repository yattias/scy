<h1>Problem presentation</h1>
<p>One of the main ideas about how ecosystem functions is that ecosystems have energy flows. The sun has produced energy for billions of years. Solar energy is the sunâ€™s rays (solar radiation) that reach the Earth. This energy can be converted into other forms of energy for example heat and electricity. It is not only humans that take advantage of the solar energy to produce other forms of energy. Most of the plants are also able to create energy from sunlight.</p>
<p>Otto and Silvia have worked with ecosystems in their class project. They have made a video telling the story of their ecosystem located off a tropical volcano. The study of ecosystems mainly consists of the study of certain processes that link the living (or biotic components) to the non-living (or abiotic components). Otto and Silvia are in their video describing how the abiotic and biotic components of their ecosystem are linked and how important sunlight is for their existence.</p>
