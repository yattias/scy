<h1>Problem presentation</h1>
<p>Ecosystems have energy flows. The sun has produced energy for billions of years and Solar energy, in the form of solar rays, reaches the earth. This energy can be converted into other forms of energy, for example, heat and electricity. Humans are not the only ones to produce other forms of energy. Most plants are also able to convert sunlight into energy.</p>
<p>Otto and Sylvia have worked on ecosystems in their class project. They have made a video about the ecosystem around a tropical volcano. The study of ecosystems consists mainly of linking the living (or biotic) components to the non-living (or abiotic) components. Otto and Sylvia describe this linking in their video, and discuss the importance of sunlight.</p>
