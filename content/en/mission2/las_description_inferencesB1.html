<p>In order to test if your previously stated hypotheses are correct, you have to run some experiments. 
Here you can compose the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experimental procedure. First you have to plan your experiment. For that, open the “Experimental procedure” ELO and follow all the instructions related to the ELO.</li>
<li>Data collection. After your experimental procedure is finished, you can start performing your experiments. For that, open the ELO “SCYDynamics model” and follow the guidelines about conducting experiments.</li>
<li>Data analysis. Open Data processing tool and analyze the data collected from your experiments.</li>
<li>Formulating inferences. Open the “Inference” ELO and make your inferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>After formulating your inferences, open the mission map and move next to the “Solution” space.
