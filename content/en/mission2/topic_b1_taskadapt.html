<h1>Applying Data Processing tool in order to make inferences</h1>
<p>If you have gathered a large collection of numerical data, it is often a good idea to (re)organize it in a structured and convenient way. You want to present your data in such that it is easy to understand what measurements you have made and what the outcome of your experiments is. You are going to plot your data in a diagram.</p>
<p>For the data with a fixed phosphate concentration, create a diagram with biomass growth (in cells/l) on the y-axis and nitrate concentration (in μmol/l) on the x-axis. Investigate the shape of the diagram. If you are acquainted with logarithmic scales, try what happens if you change the scale of the x-axis from a linear to a logarithmic scale.</p>

<p>Open data processing tool and analyse data collected from your experiments and make your inferences. The structure of a good inference is the same that it is in the case of hypothesis. Thus, you can revise <a href="guidelines_h.html">guidelines</a> given for that.</p>
