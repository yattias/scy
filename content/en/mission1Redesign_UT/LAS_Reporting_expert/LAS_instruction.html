<p>Halfway through the mission, you have to present the main findings of your expert research to your group mates. This essentially involves two activities. First you have to decide for yourself what are the main conclusions from your research. You do so by making a concept map of the topics you have investigated. </p>
<p>Once you have created your expert concept map, you can use its contents to prepare a presentation to your group. This presentation should take no longer than 10 minutes. Be ready to answer additional questions when necessary.</p>
