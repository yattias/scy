<p>Now it is time to actually carry out your experiments. If you have gone through all the preparatory work seriously, this will not be too difficult.</p> 
<p>General guidelines for experimentation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>work seriously and accurately</li>
<li>store all data carefully (these are your ‘raw’ data)</li>
<li>take notes of any deviations from your original experimental design</li>
</ul>
<p>If your experiments produce large sets of numerical data, it is often a good idea to reorganize them in a structured and convenient way. You want to present your data in such a way, that it is easy to understand what measurements you have made and what the outcome of your experiments is.</p>
<p>General guidelines for processing data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>calculate mean values (and maybe standard deviations)</li>
<li>present the most relevant data in small tables</li>
<li>plot data for independent and dependent variables in diagrams</li>
<li>use a simple statistical test to assess the validity of your conclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is time to go back to your research questions and hypotheses and see if you can draw any conclusions from your data.
