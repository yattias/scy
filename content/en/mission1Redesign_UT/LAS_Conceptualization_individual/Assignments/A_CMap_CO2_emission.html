<title>My concept map on CO2 emission</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>A concept map is a  graphical representation of important concepts (in boxes), and the relations  between those concepts (represented by arrows or lines with a label). This may  sound complicated, but if you take a look at the example in the 'resources' drawer, it will become clear what the main idea of a concept map is.</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>To get you going, think of the following focus question: </p>
<p><i>"Which factors contribute to domestic CO2 emission (and what are consequences)?"</i></p>
<p>Your concept map should answer this question. Proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Start by creating a few concepts that are important for domestic CO2 emission.
<br>2. Connect these concepts with each other. A link connecting two concepts should have a label: a word or a brief phrase that defines the relationship between these concepts.</br>
<br>3. Each concept or idea has to be connected with at least one other concept.</br>
<br>4. From that point on, your concept map will grow. You will probably think of new concepts that are related to the ones that are already in the concept map.</br>
<br>5. Of course you can always make changes to parts of your concept map you have done earlier.</br></p>
