<h1>What makes a house CO2-friendly?
</h1>
<p>Your goal is to design a CO2-friendly house. But what measures can you take to make a house CO2-friendly? In this activity you will use the drawing of a house to note down the <span class="Bold">first ideas</span> of your design group. Keep in mind that there are no right or wrong answers: every idea is welcome. The goal is simply to have a first brainstorm about your CO2-friendly house. So your ideas can be as wild and creative as you want.</p>
