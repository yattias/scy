<h1>What should I do?
</h1>
<p>You should put all ideas that result from your brainstorm in and around the schematic drawing of the house you see here. In the drawing there are three arrows. These arrows will help you to organize your ideas. For example, your idea might be related to the type of energy that flows into the house (left arrow), the amount of energy that is consumed inside the house (middle arrow), or the amount of heat that is lost (right arrow). So you have to decide in what way your idea contributes to the CO2-friendliness of your house, and place your idea above the corresponding arrow in the drawing.</p>
<h1>How do I do it?
</h1>
<p>To get you started, five items are already given. You proceed as follows:</p>
1. Drag these items to the appropriate place in the drawing, and connecting them to the corresponding arrow.<br />
2. Add as many new ideas as you want. For each idea, select a concept symbol, place it in the drawing and connect it to the appropriate arrow with one of the links.<br />
3. Make sure that each member of your design group adds at least three new items.<br /></p>
<p>Please remember that you cannot give wrong answers here. If you are not sure about whether your idea is really CO2-friendly, you simply add a question mark.</p>
