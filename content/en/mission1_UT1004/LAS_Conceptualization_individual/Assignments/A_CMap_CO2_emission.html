<h1>Concept map on domestic CO2-emission</h1>
<p>The goal of this mission is to design a CO2-friendly house. In order to do so, you need a lot of knowledge about the factors that contribute to CO2 emission. A concept map is a good way to organize that knowledge. If you make one, you will see that you know more about the topic that you initially thought. </p>
<h2>What is  concept map anyway?</h2>
<p>A concept map is a kind of diagram or schematic drawing that shows how certain topics are related. A concept map consists of several terms or concepts (called nodes) that are connected by lines or arrows (called links). The links are labelled to explain the nature of the relation, for example "depends on", "increases by", or "has an effect on". This may sound complicated, but it will all become clear by looking at the <a href="A_CMap_CO2_emission_2.html">example</a> on the next page. </p>
<h2>When do we make a concept map?</h2>
<p>You will work on your concept map three times during the project. The first time is in lesson 1 when you will be asked to represent your prior knowledge on the factors that influence domestic CO2 emission. The second time you will be working on your concept map is somewhere in the middle of the project to update your initial concept map with the knowledge you have gained so far. The third time is in the final project week when you have all he knowledge you need to draw a complete concept map.</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>To get you going, think of the following focus question: </p>
<p><i>"Which factors contribute to domestic CO2 emission (and what are consequences)?"</i></p>
<p>Your concept map should answer this question. Proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Start by creating a few concepts that are important for domestic CO2 emission.
<br>2. Connect these concepts with each other. A link connecting two concepts should have a label: a word or a brief phrase that defines the relationship between these concepts.</br>
<br>3. Each concept or idea has to be connected with at least one other concept.</br>
<br>4. From that point on, your concept map will grow. You will probably think of new concepts that are related to the ones that are already in the concept map.</br>
<br>5. Of course you can always make changes to parts of your concept map you have done earlier.</br></p>
