<h1>Why a CO2-friendly house?
</h1>
<h2>The situation
</h2>
<p>Avoid unnecessary use of energy, use renewable energy sources and use the finite energy resources as effectively as possible! Due to climate change, the environment is becoming a more important issue in the design of new houses. These are known as "climate-friendly" or "CO2-friendly" homes. </p>
<p>Important here is the choice of materials used, but also the way you deal with energy supply in the house. A well-known measure is the use of solar cells that generate energy. But there are many more ways to design a climate-friendly or CO2-friendly house.
</p>
<h2>The climate issue
</h2>
<p>The emission of CO2 causes an increase of the greenhouse effect. During the past hundred years we have used an increasing amount of fossil fuels. This increase is causing a much higher level of carbon dioxide in the air. "The blanket of gases" that holds heat around the earth, is getting thicker. The climate around the world is becoming warmer and ecosystems are being threatened. The consequences may include drought and rising sea levels. </p>
<h2>Reducing CO2 emission
</h2>
<p>If we want to do something about the greenhouse problem, we need to devise new methods to prevent CO2 emissions. For example using renewable energy sources such as solar energy. Other possibilities to reduce CO2 emission are the use of fuel-saving techniques, recycling of CO2 and methods to store CO2 in the ground or in solid materials. In the Netherlands and in other countries, scientists and engineers are working hard to discover new methods. It is very important to introduce these new techniques on a large scale. The Dutch government has investigated the potential of CO2 storage. The investigation showed that the storage of CO2 in the soil can also be applied in the Netherlands. The government plans to launch pilot projects involving this technique.</p>
