<h1>Personal report
</h1>
<p>Finally, you are going to write a short personal report. In your report you should at least reflect on the following questions:
<li>What was the quality of your experimental work? Were there any flaws in your experimental procedure? And if so, what were their consequences?</li>
<li>What is your opinion on the use of DNA in criminal cases?</li>
<li>What is your opinion on the fact that forensic researchers are not supposed to know the context of the case they are working on (e.g. names of the victim and suspects, and the nature of the crime)?</li>
<li>Did you notice anything particular about the STR profiles of the suspects? (optional)</li>
