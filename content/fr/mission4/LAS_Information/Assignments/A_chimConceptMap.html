<h1>Concept Map for chemical analysis
</h1>
<p>Make a concept map related to the technique of chemical analysis that will be used in this part of the mission: the thin layer chromatography (TLC).<br />
There is a double goal in this activity:
</p>
<li>Identify and organize the concepts related to the TLC</li>
<li>Connect the TLC to the other techniques that a chemical analyst might use.</li>
<p>The concepts are already given on the side of the Cmap. You have to organize them and give a linking phrase between the concepts.</p>
