<strong>8.1: Creation of a healthy pizza.</strong><br />
Based on what you have studied so far and  implementing the optimization strategy, create your third healthy pizza, using  the same simulation tool. This time however, the simulation tool will carry out  all the calculations for you, based on the weight value you assigned in the  previous activity. Finally, you will have to calculate the nutrients and energy  of your pizza and create a nutritional value label per serving (slice or  /100g).
