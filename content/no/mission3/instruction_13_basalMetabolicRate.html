<p><strong>13: </strong><strong>Basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong><br />
  <br />
Your body uses a lot of energy, even  when it is at rest. Your heart and lungs are working, your body temperature has  to be kept at a constant level, and there are many chemical processes going on  in all your cells. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you  use when doing all these &lsquo;basic&rsquo; things. For most people, this accounts for  more than half of the total amount of energy they spend during a day. Not  surprisingly, the BMR depends on weight and height, age and gender. The BMR is  usually measured in kcal/day.</p>
<p>1. To calculate the BMR you need your age, weight  and lenght. First, write these numbers down in your  Health Passport.</p>
<p>2. Use the following formula to  calculate your BMR:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>BMR = (10.0  x weight) + (6.25 x length) – (5.0 x age) + 5        (if you are a boy)</p>
  <p>BMR = (10.0  x weight) + (6.25 x length) – (5.0 x age) – 161    (if you are a girl)</p>
  <p>[<em>where weight is measured in kilograms (kg),  lenght in centimetres (cm) and age in years (y)</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Your BMR will be used for your Health Passport.</p>
