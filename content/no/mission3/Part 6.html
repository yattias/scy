<p><strong>6.1 Introduction</strong><br />
  <br />
The goal of  this mission is to create a healthy pizza. By now you must be familiar with the  nutrient composition of a healthy diet. You have also learned that there should  be a balance between the amount of calories in your diet and the amount of  energy you spend. But what exactly are the consequences if your diet is not  healthy? This activity focuses on the most common diet-related health problems  in our society.</p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>able  to participate in a classroom discussion and formulate their own opinions</li>
  <li>able  to organize, analyze and interpret data. </li>
  <li>able to perform simple calculations (e.g.  additions and multiplications). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific learning goals</strong><br />
  Students  will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>aware  of the importance of a balanced diet for their health.</li>
  <li>aware  of the long-term consequences of unhealthy food.</li>
  <li>able  to explain and calculate the body mass index (BMI).</li>
  <li>able  to measure the heart rate (pulse) of a person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>6.2 Food and health problems </strong></p>
<p>Unhealthy  food can be very tasty. Many people are fond of fast food products such as  French fries, hamburgers and chicken nuggets. But eating fast food on a daily  basis is not without consequences. Your teacher will show you parts of a documentary  called &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;. In this documentary, we follow Morgan Spurlock from New York, who engages in  a bizarre experiment: he will eat only fast food (at McDonalds) three meals a  day, for thirty days in a row. A number of physicians monitor his physical and  mental health during this experiment. After watching the documentary there will  be a classroom discussion. Finally, you will have to write short comments on a  set of statements related to this topic.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.1.</strong> Watch the documentary &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo; (shown by your teacher).</p>
<p>1. There  will be a classroom discussion on some of the issues brought forward by the documentary.  In preparation for the discussion, write short comments on paper (50 words  maximum) to each of the following statements.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Diet-related health problems       such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are a major threat       to our society.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
  <li>Eating healthy is entirely your       own responsibility.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
  <li>Soft drinks (such as coke or       lemonade) fit well in a healthy diet.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="a">
  <li>School canteens should not sell       fast food products at all.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="a">
  <li>Fast food restaurants (such as       McDonalds) should provide customers with more information about the       nutritional value of their products.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Participate  in the classroom discussion led by your teacher.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.2.</strong> Write down your comments to the statements  above here <em>[link to SCYLab&rsquo;s text editor]</em>.  Maybe your opinion has changed during the discussion. Thus, your final comments  may of course be different from the one&rsquo;s written before.<br />
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.3 Health passport</strong></p>
<p>You are now  going to finish the health passport for the character you have chosen. This health  passport brings together the most important facts regarding his/her diet and  health. During previous activities you have already calculated the daily  calorie intake, BMR and EER of your character. You have also evaluated his/her  diet. To complete the health passport, you will calculate the body mass index  (BMI), enter a realistic value for the heart rate and write some conclusions  and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Body Mass Index</strong><br />
  The Body  Mass Index (BMI) is used to indicate whether someone has a healthy body weight.  You probably remember the dietician measuring Morgan&rsquo;s bodyweight in &lsquo;Super  Size Me&rsquo;. To calculate the BMI, you need to know the weight (in kilograms) and  the height (in metres) of a person.</p>
<p>1. Use the  formula below to calculate the BMI of your character. Of course you have to use  the same values for the weight and the height of your character as in activity  4 (so check the health passport).</p>
<p>FIGURE 2 </p>
<p>If you do not know how to use this formula,  follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take  the height of your character in meters.</li>
  <li>Multiply  this value by itself.</li>
  <li>Divide  the weight of your character (in kg) by the outcome of the previous step.</li>
  <li>The  outcome is the BMI.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Enter  the BMI of your character in the health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see appendix A]</em>.</p>
<p>Now that  you have calculated the BMI, you probably want to know what this value says  about physical health. There are roughly four different categories:</p>
<p>Underweight                 your BMI is under 18.5<br />
  Normal weight              your BMI is in  between 18.5 and 25<br />
  Overweight                   your BMI is in between 25 and 30<br />
  Obese                           your  BMI is over 30</p>
<p>If you  would like to know your own BMI, you can use the same formula of course. But  before jumping to conclusions, you should be aware that these categories  normally apply to adults. Your body is still developing and growing, and your  BMI might change considerably over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate</strong> <br />
  You have  seen the physicians that were monitoring Morgan&rsquo;s health in &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;  measuring his heart rate and blood pressure. These values might provide  information about a person&rsquo;s health. Even though we are not physicians, and  therefore cannot make a reliable medical interpretation, it might be  interesting to measure our heart rate as well.</p>
<p>Heart rate  is measured in beats per minute (bpm). You probably know that your heart beats  a lot faster when you are exercising. For the health passport we need the <em>resting heart rate</em>. This is the heart  rate when a person is awake, but not doing any physical work. A healthy resting  heart rate will be somewhere in between 60 and 80 bpm for adults. For  teenagers, the outer limits of this healthy range are set even further apart.  Resting heart rates of 90 bpm are no exception. But heart rates below 60 bpm  are also common, especially if you exercise regularly.</p>
<p>1. Enter a  realistic value for the heart rate of your character in the health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see appendix A]</em>.  As a (very) general rule you might say that the resting heart rate becomes  lower if a person exercises more regularly.</p>
<p><em>Measuring your own heart rate</em><br />
  There are a  number of places on your body where you can feel your own pulse. A good place  to start looking for it would be your neck, where you probably will be able to  find the pulse of the so called carotid artery just below your chin (see the  drawing below).</p>
<p>FIGURE  3</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sit  down and relax your muscles. Place two fingers of one hand just below your chin  and try to find your pulse. Hold a stopwatch in your other hand. Once you have  found your pulse, start the stopwatch and count the number of heartbeats for  one minute.</li>
  <li>Ask  two of your fellow students to measure your heart rate as well.</li>
  <li>Calculate  the average of these three measurements. This value will be a reasonably good  estimate of your heart rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong> <br />
  2. Complete  the health passport with a short reflection (150 words maximum). Evaluate the balance  between daily calorie intake and the estimated energy requirements of your  character. Also note if there are any signs of an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. a  BMI that is too high). Formulate a few recommendations for your character on  how to improve his/her dietary and exercising habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Physical fitness</strong> (optional)<br />
  Another  measure that is indicative of a person&rsquo;s health is physical endurance. In  &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo; you saw Morgan running on a treadmill. You are also going to do  a fitness test. Your teacher will give you more detailed instructions on how to  proceed.</p>
