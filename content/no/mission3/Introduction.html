  <strong>Canteen  Cuisine – A Healthy Pizza</strong><br />
  <strong>________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Canteen Cuisine addresses the  need of healthy meals at school canteens/cafeterias around the world. Today,  children in Europe and the United States consume more food products high in  sugar, salt and fat content than thirty years ago. This led to the increase of many  health problems including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high  cholesterol, heart related disease and other diet-related problems. Thus, the  purpose of the Canteen Cuisine mission is to actively engage you in practices  related to the canteen/cafeteria cuisine of your school. You will be involved  in creating a healthy pizza for your school canteen/cafeteria while taking into  consideration the nutritional value of the ingredients, the human digestive  system, diet-related health issues and daily exercise.<br />
  <br />
  Pizza is one of student’s favorite  meals/snacks. However, it is also one of the unhealthiest foods since it  incorporates high levels of calories and fat. Unfortunately, pizza is served in  many school canteens/cafeterias around the world without any restrictions or  considerations about its ingredients. Pizza, however, does not have to be  unhealthy. Taking into consideration the nutritional value of different  toppings and ingredients, school canteens/cafeterias can provide a more healthy  option with less fat and calories and more vegetables.<br />
</p>
<p>Your assignment is to create a  healthy pizza to be served at your school canteen/cafeteria. In order to do so  you will follow a stepwise approach. First you will learn about the nutritional  value of food items in general (carbohydrates, fat, proteins, energy, vitamins,  etc.), and of various pizza ingredients in particular. Then you will  familiarize yourself with the food pyramid and the classification of food  products (grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, meat and beans), information on  energy (calories) and the human metabolism. Further, you will learn how to read  and interpret the label of ingredients of a products and how the digestive  system works, including diet-related health problems. Finally, you will use  your new knowledge to create a healthy pizza to be served at your school  canteen/cafeteria. In order to move on to the next step in this mission, you  must first complete the previous one. However, you will have the freedom to  revisit the steps you have already completed when ever you wish.<br />
