<p><strong>4.3 Exercise diary</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the mission you  have created a personal diet and exercise diary for a chosen character. In this  activity you are going to use the data from the exercise diary to estimate how  much energy your character has spent during this period. First, you will  calculate the amount of energy your character uses when his/her body is at  rest. This measure is referred to as the basal metabolic rate (BMR). After that  you will calculate the total estimated energy requirements (EER) of your  character.</p>
<p><strong>4.3.1: Basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong><br />
  <br />
Your body uses a lot of energy, even  when it is at rest. Your heart and lungs are working, your body temperature has  to be kept at a constant level, and there are many chemical processes going on  in all your cells. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you  use when doing all these &lsquo;basic&rsquo; things. For most people, this accounts for  more than half of the total amount of energy they spend during a day. Not  surprisingly, the BMR depends on weight and height, age and gender. The BMR is  usually measured in kcal/day.</p>
<p>1. You already know the age and  gender of your character. To calculate the BMR, you also need his/her weight  and height. Estimate what would be a realistic weight and height of your  character. Write these numbers down in your character&rsquo;s health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see Appendix C]</em>.</p>
<p>2. Use the following formula to  calculate the BMR of your character:</p>
<p>BMR = (10.0  x weight) + (6.25 x length) – (5.0 x age) + 5        (male)</p>
<p>BMR = (10.0  x weight) + (6.25 x length) – (5.0 x age) – 161    (female)</p>
<p>[<em>where weight is measured in kilograms (kg),  height in centimetres (cm) and age in years (y)</em>]</p>
<p>3. Write down the BMR of your  character in his/her health passport <em>[link  to SCYLab tool, see Appendix C]</em>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
  Estimated energy requirements (EER)</strong> <br />
  The total amount of energy you spend  on a day is of course higher than your BMR. The actual amount of calories your  body needs is expressed in a value known as the estimated energy requirements  (EER, measured in kcal/day). To estimate the EER of your character, you are  going to calculate the amount of calories he/she has spent for each day in the  exercise diary. A list of activities, and the amount of calories you burn while  doing them is found here [<em>link to spread  sheet with activity list, see appendix B</em>]. Please be aware that (an  estimate of) the BMR is already included in these numbers.</p>
<p>APPENDIX B</p>
<p>1. Use the Data Processing Tool [<em>link to Data Processing Tool</em>] to compose  a spreadsheet that looks like the example below.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>In the first two columns you fill in all       the activities your character has performed in one particular day, as well       as the duration of each activity (see the exercise diary). Please note       that duration is given in hours; so 30 minutes equals 0.5 hours.</li>
  <li>Check if the total duration of all the       activities is 24 hours.</li>
  <li>From the list of activities [<em>again a link to spread sheet with       activity list</em>] you copy the estimated amount of calories burned in one       hour (while performing that particular activity). Enter these values in       the third column. If you cannot find information in the list, check one of       the websites <a href="http://primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/calculat.htm">(http://primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/calculat.htm</a> and<br />
    <a href="http://health.discovery.com/centers/cholesterol/activity/activity.html">http://health.discovery.com/centers/cholesterol/activity/activity.html</a>),       or choose another activity from the list that you feel is approximately as       energy consuming.</li>
  <li>Now calculate the amount of calories       burned for the duration of each activity (fourth column). Multiply the       value in the second column by the value in the third column.</li>
  <li>Calculate the total amount of energy spend       during that day, by adding up all the values in the fourth column. This is       the EER of that particular day.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Follow step a. to b. for each day  in the exercise diary. Make sure that you save the spreadsheets of each  individual day.</p>
<p>3. Calculate the average EER of your  character. Write down the average EER in his/her health passport <em>[link to SCYLab tool, see Appendix C]</em>.</p>
