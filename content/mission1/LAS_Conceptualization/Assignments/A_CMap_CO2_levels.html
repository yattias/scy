<title>Concept Map on CO2-levels</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Why reduce global CO2-levels?</h1>
<p>The goal of this mission is to design a CO­2-friendly  house. But why do we want our house to be CO2-friendly? The purpose  of this assignment is to build a concept-map that explains the importance of reducing global CO2-levels. Your  concept-map should also explain the role of the carbon cycle in regulating the  climate on earth.</p>
<p>A concept-map is a graphical representation of  important concepts (in boxes), and the relations between those concepts  (represented by labelled arrows). This may sound complicated, but if you take a  look at the example below, it will become clear what the main  idea of a concept-map is.</p>
<h2>The assignment:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A beginning of the concept-map is already given.</li>
  <li>You have to add 10 other concepts at least.</li>
  <li>Each concept has to be connected with at least one  other concept with an arrow.</li>
  <li>Each connection  (relation) has to be defined. Useful labels are for instance ‘is’, ‘causes’,  ‘produces’ and ‘used for’.</li>
</ol>
