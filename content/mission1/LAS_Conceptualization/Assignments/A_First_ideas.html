<h1>What makes a house CO2-friendly?</h1>
<p>Your goal is to design  a CO2-friendly house. But what measures can you take to make a house  CO2-friendly? Use the drawing below to note down the first ideas of your design group. In  this assignment there are no right or wrong answers. The idea is simply to have  a first brainstorm about your CO2-friendly house. So your ideas can  be as wild and creative as you want.<br />
All ideas will be  placed in and around the schematic drawing of the house you see here. In the  drawing there are three arrows. These arrows might help you to organize your  ideas. For example, your idea might be related to the type of energy that flows  into the house (left arrow), the amount of energy that is consumed inside the  house (middle arrow), or the amount of energy that is lost, e.g. in the form of  energy. So you have to decide <em>in what way</em> your idea contributes to the CO2-friendliness of your house, and  connect this idea to the corresponding arrow in the drawing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>To get you started, five items are  already given (on the right). Begin by writing these items down in an  appropriate place in the drawing. Connect each item to one of the arrows.</li>
  <li>Please remember that you cannot  give wrong answers here. If you are not sure about whether your idea is really  CO2-friendly, you simply add a question mark.</li>
  <li>Add as many new ideas as you want. Make sure that  each member adds at least three new items. Connect each item to one of the  arrows. </li>
