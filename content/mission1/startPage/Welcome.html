<h1>Welcome to SCY-Lab!</h1>
  <p>The central idea of SCY Lab is to learn science by studying and creating products such as drawings, concept maps, and reports. These products are called ELOs, which stands for Emerging Learning Objects. 
<p>In center of the screen you can see the main ELO you are to be working on at the moment. Here, you have to read a text of the challenge you are facing in this mission. 
<p>On the left hand side you can see other ELOs that help you accomplish the mission. Here, you can find a video visualizing the challenge. You will always find a glossary there laying out the central concepts you will need to understand for accomplishing the mission. 
<p>When you move deeper into SCY-Lab, you will be working on multiple ELOs that will allign on top of the screen. At the moment, no objects are there yet. 
<p>In bottom part of the screen you can see specific SCY-services you will need throughout the mission. 
<ul>
<li>Use the buttons in the lower left corner of the screen to create new ELOs and search for existing ELOs.</li>
<li>Use the mission map in the lower right corner to navigate through SCY Lab. Clicking on an icon will bring you to a different part of SCY Lab where you can work on specific ELOs.</li> 
</ul></body>
