<h1>Draw your own CO2-friendly house</h1>
<p>After  each member of your group has become an expert in a particular field of  knowledge, it is time to actually start drawing your own house. Halfway  through the mission you will make an inventory of expert solutions, and make  some first choices for your own design. Maybe you have  already done that.</p>
<p>Please  remember, the reduction of CO2-emissions is the central issue. At the same time, your  house has to provide room and a reasonable level of comfort for a family of  four members (two parents and two children).</p>
<p>Use  the technical drawing tool to show what your house looks like. The tool can be used to make 3D images, side views and top views, as well as floor plans  of the house interior.</p>
