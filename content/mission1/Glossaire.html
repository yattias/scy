<p><a name="a" id="a"></a>Alternative current<br />
AC current is a specific type of electric current in which the direction of the current's flow is reversed, or alternated, on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Alternator<br />
An alternator is an electromechanical device that converts mechanical energy to alternating current electrical energy. Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field but linear alternators are occasionally used.</p>
<p><a name="b" id="b"></a>Bilan Carbon<br />
The Bilan Carbon method, developed by the French agency for environment and energy efficiency (ADEME), is a tool to evaluate Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, at the level of a company, factory, locality, individual.</p>
<p>Biofuel<br />
  Biofuels, like fossil fuels, consist of high-energy hydrocarbons derived from biomass. The chemical energy in these molecules can be harvested by combustion.</p>
<p>Building energy needs<br />
Energy needs of a building are usually estimated for a year knowing the outside temperatures and the building heat transfer coefficient. These needs are expressed in kWh per year. To compare buildings of various sizes, architects divide the building yearly energy needs by the building usable area. This coefficient is expressed in kWh per m-2 and per year.</p>
<p>Building materials<br />
All materials that can be used to build a house. It can be materials to build the structure of a wall, or a material for insulating the roof or the walls, or special glaze for windows, materials of doors, etc.  On a thermal point of view, a building material is mainly characterized by its thermal conductivity.</p>
<p><a name="c" id="c"></a>Carbon cycle<br />
The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.</p>
<p>Carbon footprint<br />
A carbon footprint is a measure of the impact our activities have on the environment, and in particular climate change. The carbon footprint is a measurement of all greenhouse gases we individually produce and has units of tonnes (or kg) of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>Chemical equation<br />
A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction.  It is a formula used to display different stages for chemical reactions, where chemical substances are changed into other substances. The elements and/or compounds to the left of the arrow in a chemical equation represent the reactants, the arrow represents the transition stage, and the species to the right of the arrow represent the products. A chemical equation should represent the stoichiometry observed in the chemical reaction.</p>
<p>CO2e<br />
cf. Equivalent CO2</p>
<p>Combustion<br />
Combustion or burning is a complex sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel (usually a hydrocarbon) and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat or both heat and light.</p>
<p>Compactness<br />
A solid is compact if the area of its external envelope is as small as possible, given its volume.  For instance, a cube is less compact than a sphere since for an equal volume, the external area of a sphere is smaller than that of a cube.</p>
<p>Conduction<br />
Heat can be transferred from a system to another system by the conduction phenomena: the thermal energy is migrating from one system to another through the matter but without matter motion. For instance, if you take a cold stone in your hands which are warmer, the stone gets progressively warmer because of heat conduction from the hands to the stone.</p>
<p>Convection<br />
In heat transfer by convection, the thermal energy is transported (ie transferred) from one system to another by a quantity of matter that is moving from one system to the other. For instance, when a quantity of hot water is carried by a water stream from a hot water zone (system 1) to a colder zone (system 2) in the ocean, this second zone will gain thermal energy (ie heat). Thermal energy is carried by matter, water in this example.</p>
<p><a name="d" id="d"></a>Direct current<br />
Direct current (DC) current is a specific type of electric current in which the direction of the current's flow does not change over time.</p>
<p><a name="e" id="e"></a>Efficiency<br />
  The efficiency (η) of an appliance is defined as the useful power output divided by the total power input. η can also be calculated from the energy, especially if the power is not available. η is thus the useful energy divided by the total energy input.<br />
Note that η has no unit because it is the ratio between two quantities that have both the same unit (here power in W, or energy in J). As an example, an incandescent light bulb consumes 100W, but only 2W is used to produce light. The resting 98% is turned to heat. The efficiency of such an electric bulb is then very low and around 0.02 (or 2%).</p>
<p>Electric current intensity<br />
The main physical quantity to describe and measure an electric current is the current intensity; its usual symbol is I and it is measured in amperes, symbol A, which is the SI unit.</p>
<p>Electric power<br />
Electrical power (P) is the amount of electrical energy (E) used by a certain device per unit time. The average value of power P over time duration t is thus: P = E / t. The SI unit of power is the watt (W); therefore 1W = 1 Js-1 (joule per second).</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation<br />
  Electromagnetic radiation (sometimes abbreviated EMR and often simply called light) is a phenomenon that takes the form of self-propagating waves in a vacuum or in matter. EM radiation carries energy that may be imparted to matter with which it interacts. <br />
EM radiation with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, close to visible light are  infrared (longer than 700 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm). Below infrared there are microwaves and radio waves. After ultraviolet, there are Xrays and gamma rays which are the most energetic EMR.</p>
<p>Endothermic reactions<br />
Endothermic reactions are chemical reactions for wich the absorption of energy in the form of heat, is needed to take place.</p>
<p>Energy<br />
  Energy is a physical quantity that characterize the state of a physical system. SI Unit is Joule : 1J = 1 kg m2 s-2 . It is also often express in Wh (watt hour) or in kWh (kilowatt hour): 1kWh = 3.6 106J. Energy in kilowatt hours is the product of power in kilowatts and time in hours; it is not &quot;kilowatts per hour&quot;.<br />
    The total energy of a system is the sum of all energy contributions that characterize the state of the system, related to its temperature, the matter that compose it, its shape, its position relatively to external objects that interact with it, its motion, …<br />
    Therefore there are various forms of energy: kinetic energy related to motion, thermal energy (also called heat) related to the matter and temperature, potential energy related to interactions, …<br />
Energy is characterized by its conservation law.  Energy can be transferred from one system to another. Energy can change form within a system or while transferring from one system to another system. Any change of the state of any system (temperature change, motion, deformation...) is characterised by a transfer and/or transformation of energies.</p>
<p>Energy conservation law<br />
nergy cannot be created or destroyed, but only transferred from one system to another. It can also change its form. It can be expressed in 2 ways : 1-  the total energy of a closed system always remains constant (an energy closed system does not exchange energy with the outside world). 2- the variation of the total energy of a (non closed) system between two states of the system equals the difference between the system energy gains and the system energy losses.</p>
<p>Energy label<br />
According to several different EU directives, most appliances have an EU Energy Label clearly displayed when offered for sale or rent. The energy efficiency of the appliance is rated in terms of a set of energy efficiency classes from A to G on the label, A being the most energy efficient, G the least efficient (A+ and A++ grades were later introduced for refrigeration products). The labels also give other useful information to the customer as they choose between various models.</p>
<p>Energy transfer<br />
Energy can be transferred from one system to another system through 3 modes of transfer: work, heat and radiation.</p>
<p>Energy Transfer modes<br />
See Energy transfer, Work, Heat transfer, Radiation transfer mode.</p>
<p>Equivalent CO2<br />
Equivalent CO2 (CO2e) is the concentration of CO2 that would cause the same increase of greenhouse effect, as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas (methane, perfluorocarbons, nitrous oxide,...). For example,  emissions of 1 kg of methane and nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 25 and 298 kg of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Exothermic reactions<br />
Chemical reactions which release energy, in the form of heat, are called exothermic reactions.</p>
<p>Experimental procedure<br />
An experimental procedure is a written document that describes an experiment for somebody who is going to execute it (eventually oneself).</p>
<p><a name="f" id="f"></a>First law of thermodynamics<br />
Same as energy conservation law</p>
<p>Fossil fuels<br />
Fossil fuels or mineral fuels are fuels formed by the natural resources such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms that lived up to 300 million years ago. These fuels contain high percentage of carbon and hydrocarbons.</p>
<p><a name="g" id="g"></a>Geothermal power<br />
Geothermal power (from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and thermos, meaning heat) is power extracted from heat stored in the earth.</p>
<p><a name="h" id="h"></a>Heat<br />
  In Physics, the word heat is used for 3 related things all related to thermal energy:<br />
    1- the amount of thermal energy that is transferred from one system to another. This is a physical quantity, and as an energy, SI unit is Joule.<br />
    2- the (amount of) thermal energy owned by a system. In this case, thermal energy is a better word, less ambiguous. This is a physical quantity, and SI unit is Joule.<br />
3- heat transfer (or thermal transfer) mode, sometimes called heat for short.</p>
<p>Heat pump<br />
  A heat pump is a machine or device that moves heat from one location (the 'source') to another location (the 'sink' or 'heat sink') using mechanical work. Thermal energy is transferred from hot to cold to heat the warm location and cool the cold location (i.e. fridge, building cooling device, heat pump heating device).<br />
This is apparently contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, but it is not a spontaneous evolution (as stated in the 2nd law), because it is forced by devices.</p>
<p>Heat transfer<br />
Heat transfer is a mode of energy transfer.  When a quantity of energy is transferred from one system to another system in the heat transfer mode, it means that the transferred energy is in the form of thermal energy for both systems. There are two ways for heat transfer, by convection or by conduction. </p>
<p>Heat transfer coefficient of a building<br />
The heat transfer coefficient of a building measures the amount of heat transferred from the inside of the building to the outside (or from outside to inside). It takes into account the heat transfer 1) by conduction through the building envelope and 2) by air convection because of the building ventilation. It is the power transferred in one hour for a temperature difference of 1° between inside and outside. Therefore it is independent of the house external environment (climate &amp; so on). It is expressed in kW K-1.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbon<br />
Hydrocarbons are organic molecules that consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. All fossil fuels are hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity<br />
Hydroelectricity is electricity generated by hydropower, i.e. falling or flowing water. The production of electrical power is done by transforming mechanical energy from the gravitational force of the flowing water to electrical energy using an alternator.</p>
<p><a name="i" id="i"></a>International system of Units (SI)<br />
The International System of Units (abbreviated SI) is a universal set of units both in everyday commerce and in science.</p>
<p><a name="j" id="j"></a>Joule effect, Joule's first law<br />
  The Joule effect is the generation of heat by the passage of electricity through a resistance.<br />
    The most common use of the Joule effect is electrical heating systems: (i.e. heater, oven, dryer, toaster). <br />
    Joule's first law states that the power dissipated by a current of intensity I, flowing through a in a resistor of resistance R is: P = R I2<br />
These appliances can completely convert the electric energy in heat by convection and radiation.</p>
<p><a name="l" id="l"></a>Light<br />
cf. Electromagnetic radiation</p>
<p><a name="n" id="n"></a>Nuclear power<br />
Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions. These reactions heat water to produce steam, which is then converted into mechanical work with a turbine for the purpose of generating electricity (using an alternator) or propulsion.</p>
<p><a name="p" id="p"></a>Photovoltaïc solar panel<br />
A photovoltaic system is a system which uses solar cells to convert light into electricity.</p>
<p>Physical quantity <br />
A physical quantity is any concept of physics that can be measured or calculated, and therefore is expressed by a numerical value. </p>
<p>Primary energy<br />
Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to undergoing any human-made conversions or transformations (coal, crude oil, sunlight, wind, running rivers, vegetation, uranium,…)</p>
<p><a name="r" id="r"></a>Radiation transfer mode<br />
The radiation transfer mode is one among the 3 modes to transfer energy from a system to another system.<br />
A system can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiations. The system that emits electromagnetic radiations looses internal energy. The system that absorbs electromagnetic radiations gains energy. For instance, if a surface is exposed to sun light, it will gain thermal energy (heat): usually a dark coloured surface will absorb more energy than a light coloured one.</p>
<p>Renewable energy<br />
Renewable energy is energy generated from natural resources—such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides and geothermal heat—which are renewable (naturally replenished).</p>
<p><a name="s" id="s"></a>Second  law of thermodynamics<br />
In spontaneous heat transfer conditions by conduction, thermal energy is always transferred from the colder system to the warmer one, and never the other way round.</p>
<p>Secondary energy<br />
Secondary energy is an energy which has been transformed from one form to another. Electricity is the most common example, being transformed from such primary sources as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind.</p>
<p>Solar energy<br />
The sunrays that reach the Earth contain energy in the form of electromagnetic waves (see electromagnetic radiations). This energy can be converted to electric energy or stored as thermal energy (heat).</p>
<p><a name="t" id="t"></a>Temperature<br />
Temperature is a physical quantity, that characterize the thermal state of a system. SI unit is K, Kelvin. Another commonly used unit is °C, Celsius degree.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity<br />
  Thermal conductivity is a physical quantity expressed in Wm-1K-1 (SI). Usual symbol is λ in Europe and K in US. Every material has its own value of thermal conductivity that characterise its thermal behaviour during heat transfer by conduction. <br />
The thermal conductivity of the material express the amount of heat (in W in SI) transferred through its 1m thickness (for a 1m2 surface) during a unit of time (1s) for this 1K temperature difference.</p>
<p>Thermal comfort<br />
Thermal comfort is about the feeling of heat of a human being in a room. Factors determining thermal comfort include personal factors (health, psychology, metabolism), air temperature, walls temperature, air movement, air relative humidity, clothing, activity level.</p>
<p>Thermal power station<br />
A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which either drives an electrical generator or does some other work, like ship propulsion.</p>
<p>Thermal radiation<br />
Thermal radiation Thermal radiation is the energy that is emitted from the surface of an object as electromagnetic waves. The amount of electromagnetic waves emitted increases with the temperature of the object.</p>
<p>Thermal solar panel<br />
A solar collector is a device for extracting the energy of the sun directly into a more usable or storable form. The energy in sunlight is in the form of electromagnetic radiation from the infrared (long) to the ultraviolet (short) wavelengths (see electromagnetic radiations).</p>
<p>Transformer<br />
A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors — the transformer's coils or &quot;windings&quot;. The voltage for the electrical energy transferred to the second circuit (called secondary)  can be modified (stepped up or stepped down) with rather little energy loss so that transformers are currently used as voltage transformers to modify the voltages between electrical circuits.</p>
<p>Turbine<br />
A turbine is a rotary engine that extracts energy from a fluid flow.</p>
<p><a name="u" id="u"></a>U-value<br />
The U-value (or U-factor), more correctly called the overall heat transfer coefficient, describes how well a building element conducts heat. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a building element of given thickness, over a unit area. Its SI unit is W/(m2K)  or W m-2K-1. Usual symbol is U. A small U-value means that the building element is not a good heat conductor.</p>
<p><a name="v" id="v"></a>Ventilation of a house<br />
Ventilation is the intentional movement of air from outside a building to the inside. The ventilation of a building is necessary to provide good air quality to the inhabitants (oxygen renewal, removes of excess air moisture, remove any unhealthy vapour...) Ventilating systems for houses can be classified in 3 main categories: natural ventilation, simple forced ventilation and heat recovery ventilation.</p>
<p><a name="w" id="w"></a>Water energy<br />
There are many ways to capture the kinetic energy of moving water. Often, falling or streaming water is used to spin a wheel. The spinning movement of this wheel drives an electrical generator, and thus, energy is generated. This principle is used in hydroelectric dams. Other installations use the kinetic energy of waves or the (horizontal and vertical) tidal movements.</p>
<p>Wind energy<br />
Wind, which is basically moving air, contains kinetic energy. This energy can be captured by wind turbines. </p>
<p>Wind turbine<br />
A wind turbine is a rotating machine which converts the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is then converted to electricity, the machine is called a wind generator, wind turbine, wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.</p>
<p>Work<br />
Work is a transfer mode of energy. When a quantity of energy is transferred to a system in the work mode, an external force is acting on this system resulting in a change of the value of the velocity of the system.  For instance, a ball is falling because of its weight and its velocity increases. In this case the ball weigh force results from the gravitational interaction between the earth and the ball. The gravitational interaction looses a quantity of energy (called gravitational potential energy) that is transferred by the mean of the weigh force work to the ball on the form of kinetic energy.</p>
