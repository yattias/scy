<p><a name="Part1" id="Part1"></a>The building sector</p>
<p>Buildings can account for about 40% of the potential  savings in energy use (Figure 1). Much building energy is wasted  because of poor design, inadequate technology and inappropriate behaviors. Both  new and existing buildings can become energy-efficient using a combination of  passive and active measures in design and operation. Incorporating the  best design and technical solutions can cut energy use by about two-thirds.</p>

<p>The number of low-energy new homes already existing in many countries,  although still confined, demonstrates that energy targets are technically achievable. User  behavior can also make a difference. For instance, wasteful behavior can add  one-third to a building’s designed energy performance, while conservation behavior  can save a third (Figure 2).</p>

<p>There are various scenarios under which future trends in energy  consumption in the building sector can be estimated (Figure 3). The  ‘Sleepwalking’ scenario envisages a continuation of current trends in energy  use, with no sustained attempt to address energy efficiency. According to this  path, total energy consumption is much higher by 2050. In the ‘Too little too  late’ scenario, there is a continuation of the current pattern of much talk and  little action. Namely, awareness keeps growing but action is piecemeal rather  than coordinated. In this case, the development of low-energy buildings is  still too slow, with energy consumption returning to current levels by 2020.  ‘Transformation’ is the only scenario that includes necessary energy savings  across the building stock. In this scenario, new energy policies are  implemented, new design approaches and technologies are applied, and new skills  are learned. This is all part of a coordinated global action. Widespread  awareness of energy priorities changes behavior and causes the rapid uptake of  increasingly energy-efficient technologies and practices.</p>

<p>Total energy use in buildings is influenced by three determinants:  population size, square meters of building per person, and energy per square  meter. These determinants are shown in the formula: total energy use =  population X space per capita x kWh per m2. The components of the  equation are affected directly by several forces. The main drivers are  demographics, social and cultural trends, the design of buildings and equipment  as well as climate. For example, ageing populations and changing lifestyles  lead to more single-person households. Social trends influence household size,  and therefore floor space and energy consumption per person. Cultural factors  influence the acceptability of various comfort levels. Building design and  choice of equipment determine the level of energy required. Climate influences  demand for energy services, especially heating and cooling. Depending upon the  afore-mentioned drivers, energy uses differ widely all over the globe (see  Figure 4).</p>

<p>Space heating is dominant in Europe, while water heating is very  significant in Japan. In rural India,  as in many developing countries, where many people do not have access to  electricity, the main energy use is cooking, mainly by using biomass. Rising  wealth in developing countries will certainly lead to higher energy use.</p>
<p><a name="Part2" id="Part2"></a>CO2-friendly house in the European context</p>
<p>The obligations of European  Union Member States on energy saving and CO2 emission  mitigation affected by the 2006/32/EC Directive  generated a great interest towards energy efficient buildings and passive house  technology. In this direction, demand for Low Energy Houses has increased. A  Low Energy House provides thermal comfort, healthy living, and lower heating  costs. For instance, Low Energy Houses in Denmark succeeded in reducing the  heating bill amount to only about 23 € per month or on a yearly basis – only  roughly the same amount that a family in Denmark pays for television license.  At the same time, the price falls within the normal range of traditional  houses. Low energy buildings make use of renewable  forms of energy, have better insulation values all over the building  envelope, the windows are usually of better quality than normally prescribed by  building regulations, better air tightness levels are achieved and heat  recovery ventilation systems are used.</p>
<p>Renewable forms of energy include solar water heating,  photovoltaic cells/panels, and wind power. Solar water heating in its simplest  form is a flat coated metal panel, insulated underneath and with pipes  containing water lying on the surface. As the panel heats from the sun, so does  the water held in the pipes. The water is circulated over the panels, and back  into the buildings hot water system. Photovoltaic cells/panels are composed of  specially formulated cells that produce an electric current when light falls  upon them. These are the same technology that a solar powered calculator uses  for power, only on a larger scale. As demand increases, the overall cost of an  installation is rapidly decreasing, especially allowing photovoltaic panels to  be used for far more projects, including domestic use. Wind turbines generate  clean and renewable energy with no harmful emissions and can thus help reduce a  significant proportion of CO2 emissions. </p>
<p>Low Energy Houses use Passive Solar Design, specific  orientation for windows, and recovery ventilation systems. Passive Solar Design  in Low Energy Houses is based on two principles of ‘letting the sun come in’  and then ‘not letting it out again'. Insulation is built into the external  envelope to significantly reduce the transfer of heat through the walls, roof  and ground floor. The building envelope must be made airtight by careful and  robust detailing in order to keep the heat loss to a minimum and to maintain a  comfortable air temperature. Concerning windows, north-facing orientation is  suitable. The windows should be large in cool climates, small and high-set when  summer is hot and dry. There should not be much east-facing glass, even less on  western walls. In hot, dry climates, there should be no eastern or western  windows at all. Further, to reach very low levels of energy consumption (below  30-40 kWh/(m².a)) in residential buildings, balanced ventilation systems with  heat recovery are needed, as otherwise there will be energy loss through  ventilation and air leakage. In some cases, even room heating can be provided  through the ventilation system. Occupant acceptance of balanced ventilation and  attached heating systems will strongly influence the chances of the wide  dissemination of very low energy buildings.</p>
<p>A connectedness with the  outdoors throughout the year is a key consideration in Low Energy Houses. An  exemplary case should intend for the passive solar design to take care of most  space heating requirements. Window overhangs are configured to admit low angle  winter sun and shade from summer sun (see Figures 5 and 6, respectively).</p>

<p>The  insulated concrete floors provide thermal mass (Figure 5). High insulation  levels are also a key feature of the design. All windows and doors are  double-glazed. Windows allow for good sealing when closed and act as large  louvers when open. Blinds are provided for additional thermal comfort and to  secure warm ambient temperatures on cool nights. Smaller windows facilitate  cross ventilation and the necessary ‘relief valve’ to combat overheating in  summer (Figure 6). No air-conditioning is proposed for the house. Cooling will  be provided by ceiling fans, cross breezes and the use of the thermal mass in  the floor.</p>

<p>All  buildings built after 31 December 2018 in European Members States will have to  produce as much energy as they consume on-site. The European  Parliament amended the 2002 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive  and called for more public investments in energy-efficient buildings.  Parliament also instructed Member States to set intermediate national targets  for existing buildings. If Member States succeed in accomplishing this  objective, there will be zero-energy buildings all across European Union after  2018. Zero-energy buildings are defined as buildings where the overall annual  primary energy consumption is equal to or less than the energy production from  renewable energy sources on site. Additionally, buildings’ energy performance  will be upgraded to meet minimum energy performance requirements whenever they  undergo major renovations or building components and technical building systems  (e.g., windows, boilers or air conditioning systems) are replaced. The European Commission will have to establish a  common methodology for calculating the energy performance of buildings by 31  March 2010.</p>
<p><a name="Part3" id="Part3"></a>Labels design and process</p>
<p>In European dwellings, the average energy consumption  for heat is around 200-250 KWh/m2/y. Specifications of Low Energy  Houses can lead to a decrease of this figure to about one-third. Since  the necessity of improving the entire building process has become apparent,  several labels or design processes have been developed in order to standardize,  control, and promote best practices concerning low energy demand dwellings. For  instance, they focus on requirements on insulation for fenestration, ceiling  and walls. </p>
<p>The PassivHaus  (Passive House) Institute in Darmstadt,   Germany,  provides a quite demanding type of label. Its technical specifications are best  suited for climate conditions between 40 and 60 degrees latitude in the  Northern Hemisphere. Three criteria should be met for a house to be  certified as a ‘PassivHaus’ (http://www.passiv.de/):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inner climate  should be maintained without the use of a central heating or  cooling system, which implies that the annual heat demand for such a dwelling  must be set at a value lower than 15 KWh/m2/y.</li>
  <li>Specific  comfort criteria have to be respected in every room of the house, in an annual  basis. The label requires every external surface to have U-values lower than 0.15 W/(m2K) and  every window to have U-values lower than 0.8 W/(m2K).</li>
  <li>The  total energy use for heating, hot water, and specific electricity may not  exceed 120 KWh/m2/y. </li>
</ol>
<p>Concerning  passive systems implemented in the field of heating, the best way to reduce  energy consumption is to take advantage of all available natural energy. This  is the purpose of bioclimatic design, which  is one path to a low energy house. The bioclimatic approach operates at two  levels: first, let the energy of the sun come in, and second, do not let it out  again. However, the fact that Low Energy Houses are designed to let a lot of  solar energy in, and not let it out again, can cause overheating on sunny days.  Therefore, the occupants' behavior in the building during the summer needs to  be carefully studied and cooling measures should be taken.</p>
<p>The best passive  devices to let the energy of the sun come in are windows. In Low Energy Houses,  south facing windows act as energy absorbers. Implementing large, south-facing  spaces is frequently easy in the design process of a new building. In retrofit programs, a simple widening of existing  windows can be a great help. Reflective blinds can also let more solar energy enter  the house. When properly oriented, they can increase the energy input by 25% or  more.</p>
<p>Heat losses  through surfaces can be greatly reduced. During the building of the house, one  should choose thick and efficient insulation on walls, roofs and floors, and  use efficient, double glazed windows. Since materials are sold with a given  insulation and performance value, this point is easily achievable. Any  additional cost at this stage will be later offset by gains through reduced  energy consumption.</p>
<p>Behavioural  actions, namely, modifying the interaction between inhabitants and the dwelling  are a key element in Low Energy Houses. For example, there is a very important  interaction between inhabitants and interior climate: maintaining the balance  when one parameter changes can be achieved by changing another parameter.  Reducing the temperature from 27ºC to 25ºC using an air conditioning system  leads to an energy consumption increase of 10 to 20%, whereas the same result  in terms of physiological comfort is achievable by changing clothing or  increasing air velocity (inexpensive fan using significantly less energy).</p>
<p>Most labels  insist on the initial choice of class A (or A+ or  A++) equipment, in reference to the European energy labeling for  refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers, driers, ovens, and hot  water heaters. </p>
A  standard low energy water heating solution is the solar  water heater, because it uses a cost-free energy, and can supply up to  70% of the requirement. Solar heating systems always need a complementary  energy source to ensure that the service is maintained on cloudy days.
