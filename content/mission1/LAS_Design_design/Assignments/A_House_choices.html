<h1>List of choices
</h1>
<h2>Decide what will be the characteristics of your CO2-friendly house
</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the mission you have been engaged in a brainstorm session with your group, to note down your ‘First ideas’. After you have specialized yourselves in different topics, you have made an ‘Inventory of possible solutions’, combining the knowledge on all fields of expertise. For this assignment you will use the same tool, with the schematic drawing of a house, one last time. This time, only the solutions and ideas that you actually decide to use for your own house will be shown.</p>
<p>Use the schematic drawing to present all the characteristics of your own house design. It could be a good idea to start with the ‘Inventory of possible solutions’ and to delete all solutions that your group decides not to use. So, make a selection of all the appliances that should be in your house. Also try to make a decision regarding the energy source(s) for your house. Of course you also need to discuss the shape, size and other architectural features of your house, and make some choices there.</p>
<p>Probably, this ‘list of choices’ will grow organically throughout the following lessons. So you can add (and delete) items later on, according to the development of the design process.</p>
