<h1 class="mainTitle">Design a CO2-friendly houses</h1>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Introduction</span><br />
</h2>
<p>Global warming is considered among the most pressing problems mankind is  facing. Global warming is related to climate change through the greenhouse  effect. There have been various international conventions, such as the Kyoto  protocol, trying to set thresholds to emissions of greenhouse gases, with CO2  being the most prominent one. A crucial question is what could we do at the  local level to face global warming? Recently, there have been a series of  innovations that addressed decreasing CO2 emissions of households.  There are plenty of adjustments one could plan so as to decrease the CO2 ‘footprint’ of his or her household. Indeed, there is a new type  of houses, called CO2-friendly houses, which produce much less CO2  emissions compared to ‘conventional’ houses. </p>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Context</span><br />
</h2>
<p>You work as a project engineer at “Bioenergy” in Grenoble (The place’s name can be changed or removed).  “Bioenergy” is a design office specialized in energy and sustainable  development. The mayor of your town asks Bioenergy to realize a study about  “How to design and use a CO2‐friendly house?” He wants this study in  order to provide advices to potential new habitants of his town who would like  to build their houses.</p>
<h2><span class="subTitle">Situation</span> (This part can be removed by the teacher)<br />
</h2>
<p>Avoid unnecessary use of energy, use renewable energy  sources and use the finite energy resources as effectively as possible!  Important here is the choice of materials used, but also the way you deal with  energy supply in the house. A well-known measure is the use of solar cells that  generate energy. But there are many more ways to design a CO2-friendly  house.</p>
<h2><span class="subTitle">The assignment</span><br />
</h2>
<p>In order to realize  this study and write a report for the mayor, your job is to design a newly  built CO2-friendly house in  which CO2 emissions  reduction is the central issue. The house has to be designed for a family of 4 members (parents and 2 children, 8 and 10 years  old) (This  part can be changed). In order to do this you need to complete the  following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find out in what ways CO2 emissions from houses can be  influenced. Consider materials, the design of the house, the way energy is  supplied etc. Make a long list of sub-problems and ideas and organize them into  3 expert fields.
  </li>
  <li>In each expert field, search for information and make real or virtual  experiments to describe how CO2 emission from houses works. Make your conclusions your CO2-friendly house.
  </li>
  <li>Compare  expert findings, discuss and choose your way to reduce the CO2 emissions.  Test the effects of your choice (several choices should  be tested).
  </li>
  <li>Make  technical drawings (3D and plan) of your CO2-friendly house and describe it: size, shape, materials, CO2 emission,  heat loss coefficient, energy source, energy consumption and other information  you think relevant.
  </li>
  <li>Write a  report presenting your work and your conclusions to the mayor of your town.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>End product  (if the teacher does not keep the list for the assignment).
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Technical drawings of the house (3D and plan) and a description
  </li>
  <li>Report for the mayor of  your town with the list of all choices proposed. Don’t forget your arguments  and reasoning.
  </li>
</ol>
