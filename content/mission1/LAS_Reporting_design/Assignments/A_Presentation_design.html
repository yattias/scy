<h1>Final presentation
</h1>
<p>At the end of the mission, you have to present the final design of your CO2-friendly house to the building company, and the other groups. </p>
<p>Use PowerPoint to prepare your presentation. You may use any file or document that you have made so far. So, include small texts, images, figures, graphs, concept-maps, data from the simulation, or any other item that you think is relevant. Similar to the design assignment itself, the following elements should be incorporated in the presentation:<br />
-	House drawings<br />
-	Design implications<br />
-	House data
</p>
<p>While preparing your presentation, make sure you have an overview of all the choices your group has made. During the presentation, you may have to support these decisions by brief argumentations. </p>
