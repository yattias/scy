<h1>How do you present your findings in your design group?</h1>
<p>You have to present the  main findings of your expert group to your design group. The concept-map you  have (or you are going to) produced will be an important instrument to tell your classmates about  everything that you have learned.</p>
<p>But, to  present your conclusions, you  should argue for by giving some information about the experiments and reasoning that you have done. So, following the same steps you have done  yourself, prepare a presentation (poster, slides...) about your research questions and hypotheses, describe the (virtual  or real) experiments you have conducted, and summarize the main results and conclusions. Then, return to your design group and present your conclusions.</p>
The presentation to your design group   should take no longer than 10 minutes. Be ready to answer additional questions  when necessary.
