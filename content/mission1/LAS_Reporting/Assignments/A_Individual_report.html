<p>Write a report  for the mayor</p>
<p>You have learnt a lot of things during this mission. You  have become an expert yourself, you have exchanged your expert knowledge with  the other members of your design group, and together you have designed a CO2-friendly  house. Now your task is to write an individual report to present <em>BioEnergy’s</em> whole study to the mayor of  your city. The report has to be both informative and easy to read, so that the  mayor (and potential inhabitants) of your city will be able to understand it.</p>
<p>Your report will consist of (at least) the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Introduction</em></li>
  <li><em>Why reduce global CO2-levels?</em><br />
    Explain the potential dangers of rising CO2-levels. You may use your  concept-map to support your text.</li>
  <li><em>Houses and CO2-emissions</em><br />
    Explain the main factors that contribute to the carbon footprint of a house.  These are the issues that the builders and inhabitants of a house will have to  deal with. Make sure to incorporate information from all three expert domains.  Again, you may include (expert) concept-maps, information from existing resources  (re-written in your own words) and other documents in your report.</li>
  <li><em>BioEnergy</em>’s<em> proposal for  a CO2-friendly house</em><br />
    Present your final design. Also describe the reasoning behind  the choices that were made by your design  group.</li>
  <li><em>List of resources</em> </li>
  <li><em>Appendix<br />
  </em>As an appendix, you will add a concise report on three  experiments that you, or another member of your design group, has performed.  For each experiment, describe the research question, hypothesis, experimental  procedure, results and conclusions.</li>
</ul>
You can also add other  findings or documents you have produced during the mission. You can also make  some comments about the CO2-friendly house(s) produced by other  design groups.
