<h1>House drawings
</h1>
<h2>Design your own CO2-friendly house
</h2>
<p>After each member of your group has become an expert in a particular
field of knowledge, it is time to actually start designing your own
CO&not;2-friendly house. At the end of the mission you have to present
your (BioEnergy&rsquo;s) house design to the mayor of your city. Please
remember, the reduction of CO2-emissions is the central issue. But at
the same time, your house has to provide room and a reasonable level of
comfort for a family of four members (two parents and two children).</p>
<p>Your design group has to produce a collection of drawings that
include:<br />
- drawings of the exterior of the house (front view, side view and top
view),<br />
- floor plans of the interior of the house,<br />
- a 3D artist&rsquo;s impression.<br />
All drawings except for the artist&rsquo;s impression must specify
dimensions (e.g. size of walls, windows, etc.).</p>
This is a test!
<p>Your house drawings can be produced in different ways:<br />
- using Google SketchUp (you can download SketchUp for free at <a
 href="http://sketchup.google.com" class="external" target="_external">http://sketchup.google.com</a>),<br />
- using other (technical) drawing software,<br />
- using pencil and paper (and a ruler, to make sure that dimensions are
accurate).
