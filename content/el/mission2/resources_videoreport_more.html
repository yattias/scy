<h1>Windows Movie Maker manual</h1>
<p>Windows Movie Maker is fairly easy to use. Below are some basic instructions. For more detailed instructions, see the tutorial(s) on:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/getstarted/default.mspx" target="_external">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/getstarted/default.mspx</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Open</b> WMM (or download it from: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/moviemaker2.mspx" target="_external">Microsoft</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>First you have to <b>import</b> all the video material you want to use to your computer. In WMM, you can choose between two menus: Tasks and Collections. Choose the Tasks menu. Click ‘Capture from video device’. [If your video material is already on your computer, click ‘Import video’.] WMM will ask you to give your video a name. In the following window you can alter some basic settings (resolution, etc.), but the default settings are generally okay. Then you can start actually capturing your video clips: just start your camera in playback mode and click ‘Start Capture’ to begin transferring the material onto your computer. Finally, click ‘Stop Capture’ and ‘Finish’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>The video material you have imported will now be visible in WMM’s Collections window. WMM will cut your video material into <b>shorter clips</b> if you right-click on the video icon and choose ‘Create Clips’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>  
  <li>At the bottom side of the window you see either a Storyboard or a Timeline. This is where you actually compose your video from individual clips. Simply <b>drag</b> the clips to the Storyboard or Timeline in the order you want.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Probably you don’t want to use all clips from beginning to end. Some material might not be suitable (e.g. shaking images) or a clip may be simply too long. You can <b>trim</b> a clip by selecting it, and playing the clip in the Preview Monitor (on the right side of the window) to the exact point where you want to cut it. Click the ‘Split Clip’ button in the Preview Monitor. In the Storyboard (or Timeline) you can see that the original clip is now divided into two sections. Delete the section of the clip you do not want to use.</li>
  <li>Under ‘2. Edit Movie’ you can select <b>special features</b> such as titles, video-effects, transitions between clips.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Click ‘Save to my computer’ (under ‘3. Finish Video’) and WMM will render your compilation of clips (including titles, transitions, etc.) into <b>one (final) movie</b>.
</li>
</ul>
