<h3>Interactions between species</h3>
<p>Interactions between species are not confined to their feeding habits. There are three basic types of interactions, which are approached on the basis of their effects on the species involved. In predation, the predator benefits (+), while the prey is disadvantaged (-). Typical examples for predation are the wolf vs. deer interaction in terrestrial ecosystems and the pike vs. roach interaction in aquatic ecosystems. Species might compete with each other. This is most frequently attributed to the fact that resources available are often limited (e.g., food). Any example that involves two carnivores feeding on the same prey species might evolve in a competitive interaction between the two predators. In this case, both species are affected negatively.</p>
<h3>Distinction between prey-predator relationship and competition</h3>
<p>Note that the prey-predator relationship is distinguished from competition because these two interactions are accompanied by different effects on the species engaged: Whereas predation is a ‘+/-‘ interaction type (i.e., the predator benefits, while the prey is negatively affected), competition is a ‘-/-‘ interaction type (both species are affected negatively).</p>
<h3>Mutualism</h3>
<p>Another type of interaction is mutualism, where both species benefit (+/+ type of interaction). A typical example of mutualism in terrestrial ecosystems is pollination, where insects get nectar and plants are supported in their reproduction through the transfer of pollen. The symbiosis between the clownfish and the anemone is an interesting example of mutualism in aquatic ecosystems. Due to special mucus, clownfish can dwell among the tentacles of anemones and not get stung. At the same time, the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators. Therefore, the clownfish benefits from the housing and protection of the anemone. In return, the anemoned from anemone-eating animals, gets the scraps the clownfish brings and can sting and digest the large fish that the clownfish lures in.</p>
<h3>The impact of prey-predator relationship on the characteristic features of species</h3>
<p>The interactions between species have a significant impact on the characteristic features of species. Focusing on prey-predator relationships, traits that are crucial in determining a predator‘s ability to capture individuals of the prey population will tend to increase their frequency in the predator population, namely, more individuals are expected to carry those traits in future generations. Accordingly, traits that reinforce the prey‘s ability to avoid its predator will tend to increase in frequency in the forthcoming generations. Since the traits selected for each partner of the relationship are not compatible, the prey-predator relationship is continuously evolving. Quite interestingly, the behaviour of the predator determines to a large extent the features of the prey and vice versa.</p>
