<h1>Description of the game simulation</h1>
<p>This game will simulate the interaction between the prey and the predator populations. You will form two initial groups: The prey group, and the predator group. Students adhering to the prey group will represent individuals of the prey population, whereas students in the predator group will represent individuals of the predator population. The individuals of the predator population will attack and feed on individuals of the prey population. But there are rules while … eating or while ... being eaten:</p>
<ul><li>Each individual of the predator population captures one individual of the prey population per unit of time. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Each individual of the prey population that is captured is transformed into an individual of the predator population.</li></ul>
<ul><li>All individuals of the predator population capture prey.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If an individual of the predator population cannot find any prey, it is transformed into prey.</li></ul>
<p>A boy or a girl will have to record the number of pikes and roaches for each point in time. He/she will also monitor the behaviour of ‘pikes’ and ‘roaches’ to secure that the rules of the game are followed. You will play the game by following the rules for ten units of time.</p>
