<h1>Research questions</h1>
<p>By now you have to be able to handle the most important concepts necessary to describe relationships between trophic levels, aquatic ecosystems, and prey-predator interactions. Aquatic ecosystems can contain a number of fish species. As in terrestrial ecosystems, there are predator and prey populations among fish species. Let us say that in a lake there is a population of four pikes (predator population) and ten roaches (prey population). The next step of your investigation involves experimentation with a game modelling of the prey-predator relationship. First, you have to read the description of the game simulation (see next section). Afterwards, you have to formulate your main research questions. The research questions will have to be related to the result of the game simulation and should describe what you want to find out through the game modelling. Note that each research question you formulate should contain only variables, which you are able to measure by collecting data by the game modelling of the prey-predator relationship. Most frequently, research questions attempt to address a possible relation between two variables (e.g., ‘What is the relation between variable 1 and variable 2?’). You can start by defining the variables that can be measured by the game modelling. You can also read the description of the <a href="topic_b3_game.html">game</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have to formulate your research questions.</p>
