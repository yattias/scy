<h1>Problem presentation</h1>
<p>Otto and Sylvia are classmates and both dedicated fishers. Last summer they set out on a fishing trip to a remote lake, as they were bored of fishing on the same river near their hometown every time. When they arrived at their destination, it turned out that the lake was all green, instead of the bluish colour they had expected. They also noted that the local authorities had put up a sign saying that it was forbidden to swim in the lake due to eutrophication and risk of botulism. Nevertheless, they took out their fishing rods and tried to catch pike and perch. They used shiny lures, which had always worked well in the river in their hometown. However, after three hours of waiting patiently, they still had not caught anything. After eating their lunch, they started to use dough as bait, hoping that they might catch some smaller species of fish. But when it was time to go home, their bucket was still empty. So while the conditions in the lake were such that the algae flourished, there appeared to be no fish at all.</p>
