<h1>Guidelines for designing an experimental procedure</h1>
<p>Here are some guidelines that might help you to make your experimental procedure:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" >
  	<tr>
	  <td width="15">1.</td>
      <td>The list of tasks is complete. All parameters and materials are specified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">2.</td>
      <td>The list of tasks is structured in such a way that it is easy to understand. Tasks could be organized in steps and sub-steps.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">3.</td>
      <td>The variables described in the research question(s) correspond with the parameters that will be changed during the experiment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td width="15">4.</td>
      <td>Only one variable will be changed at a time.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
