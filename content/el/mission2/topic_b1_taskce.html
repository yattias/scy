<h1>Conducting the experiment in real</h1>
<p>Now it is time to actually carry out your experiments. If you have gone through all the preparatory work seriously, this will not be too difficult. Work seriously and accurately, store all data carefully (these are your &quot;raw&quot; data) and take notes of any deviations from your original experimental design.</p>
<p>If you are going to work with SCYDynamics for the first time, it is a good idea to complete this <a href="manual_scydyn.html">introductory task</a> first.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with SCYDynamics, you can start performing your own (virtual) experiments. You are going to start with the simple model. For your experiments you can change the following variables: ‘N’ (nitrate concentration), ‘P’ (phosphate concentration) and ‘Biomass’. The variables ‘affinity P’, ‘affinity N’, ‘max. growth rate’ and ‘mortality rate’ are biological constants and remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Now it’s your time to start with experimenting. <a href="topic_b1_taskexp.html">Experimental procedure</a> developed by experts could help you at this stage.</p>
