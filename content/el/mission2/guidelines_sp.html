<ul><li>If your hypothesis turns out to be correct, you can move on to other research questions. Sometimes, your data will also give rise to new research questions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If your hypothesis turns out to be incorrect, this doesn’t mean that your whole research was not successful. Knowing that your hypothesis was false, is also ‘new knowledge’. Sometimes, it is even possible to give an answer to your research question right away. In other cases, it is necessary to construct a new hypothesis and to design and run new experiments.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Another conclusion might be that your data are insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. Then it might be a good idea to change your experimental design and / or run more experiments.</li></ul>
