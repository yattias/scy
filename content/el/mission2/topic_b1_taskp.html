<h1>Formulating problem</h1>
<p>You have read the story of Otto and Sylvia, having difficulty catching any fish in the green lake. The story of Otto and Sylvia is of course made-up. But the problem of the green lakes is real: many freshwater bodies in Europe and other continents are currently in a state where certain species of algae are very abundant, but where there are hardly any fish anymore. Your job is to find out what abiotic component makes the algae grow so abundantly. First, do some background <a href="topic_b1_back.html">reading</a>. Second, take a look at the dynamic model that has been created for you to carry out your experiments. Probably you will not understand the ins and outs of this model right away. A good starting point is to find out what are the variables used in this model. If you are going to work with SCYDynamics for the first time, it is a good idea to complete this introductory <a href="manual_scydyn.html">task</a> first.</p> 
<p>After you have become acquainted with the most important terms and concepts related to this phenomenon, try to formulate the main problem in a few sentences (50 words maximum).</p>
<p>Now you have to formulate with your own words the main problem in this situation.</p>
