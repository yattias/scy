<h1 class="mainTitle">Influence of pH on aquatic life</h1>
<p>As it was said earlier, serious fluctuations of pH in aquatic ecosystems can cause severe damage to organisms living there. One factor which lowers the pH of water bodies is acid rain. The term ‘acid rain’ refers to any form of precipitation such as rain, fog, snow or hail which contains nitric and sulphuric acids. These acids form in air from nitrogen and sulphur oxides emitted by industry, transportation and power plants.</p> 
<p>Aquatic organisms require the pH of water to be within an optimal range in order to grow and survive. Most of aquatic organisms prefer pH ranging 6.5 – 8.0. Outside of this range reproduction can suffer and species even extinct if the pH is differing greatly from the values optimal for their growth. In addition to that, low pH can cause the release of toxic metals and compounds from sediments into the water. Changes in pH also have influence on the availability of plant nutrients (phosphate, ammonia, iron).</p>
