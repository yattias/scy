<p>Inferences can be formulated either on the basis of the SCYDynamics model or prey-predator game. The structure of a good inferences is the same that is in the case of hypothesis.</p>
<p>Often the experiment sets some limitations for interpreting the results and making inferences. Please think on your experiment and describe what limitations have to be taken into account with your inferences, i.e. are valid only in the case of certain species of plants, etc.</p>

<h3>Here you can find guidelines for making inferences.</h3>
<ul><li>An inference is a clear and concise answer to research question derived from data analysis.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The structure of an inference is similar to the structure of a hypothesis: it contains dependent and independent variable and describes how dependent variable is influenced by independent variable.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many inferences are phrased as ‘if … , then … ’ statements.</li></ul>
