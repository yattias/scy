<p><strong>07: Pizza  ingredient table</strong><br />
</p>
<p><em>Please note that this activity is optional! Ask your teacher whether you have to do this assignment or not.</em></p>
<p>In the occasion of available time and appropriate equipment, 
you can collect the nutritional value information of the pizza ingredients and complete the table here on your own. 
You may visit your local supermarket/grocery store or carry out your search via the internet. 
While collecting the data, you can take paper notes or use available mobile data storing devices (e.g. cell-phones, palm-pilots, etc.). 
Since there are many <a href="http://www.scy-lab.eu/content/en/mission3/resource_07_pizzaIngredientsTable.html" target ="_moreResources">ingredients</a>
in the table, 
it will be better to form groups and look up the information for some of the ingredients (e.g. 5-10 ingredients per group) 
or your teacher can provide a semi-complete table and you will have to complete the missing information. 
You will be able to use the complete table later on during the optimization strategy.<br />

<p>
What to do next: After you complete this activity, please return to the mission map and proceed with the "Construction of the Food Pyramid" and the "Questions about the Food Pyramid" activity.</p>
