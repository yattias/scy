<p><strong>7.2.1: Importance of criteria.</strong><br />
  The  first step is to convert all the data into one common scale. In the table  bellow, each criterion is given a value based on the characteristics of each  car. For example, for the &lsquo;cost&rsquo; criterion, Mr. Adam assigned car C a low score  of 5 since it is the most expensive of the three vehicles. In contrast, he  assigned car B a score of 10 since it is the cheapest. Car A received a high  score of 9 since it&rsquo;s also cheap but not as cheap as car B. The last column  provides a total score for all criteria of each car. In this case, Mr. Adam  would have chosen Car B.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation of the optimization strategy: 2nd  step</strong> <br />
  Until  now, Mr. Adam considered the three criteria as equally important. However, in a  discussion he had with a friend, who is more knowledgeable about cars, made him  realize that the &lsquo;guarantee&rsquo; is the most important criterion and that the cost  is more important than fuel consumption. Thus, while he should take into  consideration all three criteria, he must give somehow more emphasis on the  guarantee (10 on a scale of 10), then the cost (8 on a scale of 10) and finally  the fuel consumption (5 on a scale of 10) of each car.</p>
<p>The  following tables present the new total scores based on the emphasis of each  criterion: </p>

<p>Based  on the new scores from the optimization strategy, Mr. Adam decided to choose  car A instead of car B.</p>
