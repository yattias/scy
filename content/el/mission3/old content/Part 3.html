<p align="center"><strong>Part 3:  Food Pyramid</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />
  3.1: Food  pyramid information.<br />
  3.2: Food pyramid simulation.<br />
  3.3.1: The food diary of your character:  Calculate daily caloric intake. The students will <br />
  compare their personal food diary<strong> </strong>(activity 1.4.1) with the daily required quantity   <br />
  (activity 2.1.1) and the food  pyramid recommendations (activity 3.1) and derive  <br />
  conclusions on how healthy is their diet.  In addition, the students will use this <br />
  information to complete their personal  &lsquo;health passport&rsquo; (activity 6.3).<br />
  3.3.2: Evaluate  alter-ego/self diet in terms of the food pyramid. <br />
  <strong>________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of  Activity 3: </strong>In this activity, you will familiarize yourself with the food  pyramid (old/new) and its function. In addition, you will learn how to  construct the food pyramid by placing different food products in the appropriate  pyramid group. Finally, you will compare your/alter-ego diet with the daily  nutritional value and the food pyramid requirements.</p>
<p><strong>General learning  goals and skills</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>organize, analyze and interpret data.</li>
  <li>collaborate with peers (share tasks/information,  collaborate on experiments, make decision together, etc.).</li>
  <li>write individual reports and assignments.</li>
  <li>perform  simple calculations (e.g. additions and multiplications). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain-specific  learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>learn about the concept of the food pyramid (old  and new) and its purpose. </li>
  <li>learn about the different groups of food  products and frequency of consumption.</li>
  <li>learn how to construct a food pyramid by placing  different food products in the correct group.</li>
  <li>learn how to assess your own eating habits  (health passport).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.1: Food pyramid  information </strong><br />
  During the last activity, you have learned about nutrients  and their functions. Another way to look at the diet of your character, is to  consider not the nutrients in it, but the food items themselves. In 1992 the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a dietary guide, in  the schematic form of a pyramid, in order to promote a healthy diet while  helping to reduce the possibilities of chronic degenerative diseases. However,  because of the development of diet science and dietetics, the revision of this  model of diet was inevitable. As a result, in recent years the USDA presented  the new alimentary pyramid named &ldquo;My Pyramid,&rdquo; quite different from the old  one.</p>
<p>Watch the following video and find the differences between  the old and the new food pyramid and explain why these changes were necessary. Use  the text editor tool and record your answers as a group.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>3.2: Food pyramid  simulation </strong><br />
  The simulation bellow provides the structure of the new food  pyramid and several food 
  products. Your job is to place each food product in the  appropriate pyramid group. In case you misplace a product, the simulator will  let you know. However, it will not tell you which product was misplaced; you  must find it on your own. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>3.3: The food diary  of your character </strong><br />
Now it is time to calculate the daily caloric intake of your alter-ego/self. Please follow the instructions bellow.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.1. Calculate daily calorie intake </strong><br />
Use the food and exercise diary you created in activity 1.4.1a or b and create a table like the example below (in SCY data processing tool):
<ul>
  <li>Take the food diary  of your character/self.</li>
  <li>Make an inventory  of all food items and the amounts consumed (for all three days combined).</li>
  <li>Find the amount of  calories per 100g for each item. </li>
  <li>Use the data  processing tool to calculate the amount of calories consumed (for each food  item) and the total amount of calories.</li>
  <li>Divide the  resulting value by three in order to find the average daily amount of calories  your alter-ego/self consumes.</li>
  <li>Put this value in  the health passport.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>TABLE 6</p>
<p><strong><br />
  3.3.2. Evaluate alter-ego/self diet in terms of the food pyramid </strong><br />
Evaluate the eating and drinking habits of your alter-ego/self  in terms of the food pyramid. Write a short text in the health passport, including  a conclusions and recommendations section, about the food diet of your  alter-ego/self in consideration of the questions bellow. During activity 6, you  will finalize this text.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Does the diet  include food products that contain all the necessary nutrients?</em></li>
  <li><em>Does the  diet include the appropriate amount of necessary nutrients?</em></li>
  <li><em>Does the  diet include food products from all groups according to the recommendations of  the food pyramid?</em></li>
  <li><em>Is the  amount (percentage) of the food consumed (from each category) according to the  recommendations of the food pyramid? </em></li>
  <li><em>How can the  diet be improved in order to be healthy?</em></li>
</ul>
