<p><strong>6.2 Food and health problems </strong></p>
<p>Unhealthy  food can be very tasty. Many people are fond of fast food products such as  French fries, hamburgers and chicken nuggets. But eating fast food on a daily  basis is not without consequences. Your teacher will show you parts of a documentary  called &lsquo;Super Size Me&rsquo;. In this documentary, we follow Morgan Spurlock from New York, who engages in  a bizarre experiment: he will eat only fast food (at McDonalds) three meals a  day, for thirty days in a row. A number of physicians monitor his physical and  mental health during this experiment. After watching the documentary there will  be a classroom discussion. Finally, you will have to write short comments on a  set of statements related to this topic.</p>
