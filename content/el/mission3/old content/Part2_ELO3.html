<p><strong>2.4: Optional:  Ingredients Table</strong><br />
  In the occasion of available time and appropriate equipment  (mobile devices/mobile phones), students can collect the nutritional value  information of the pizza ingredients and complete the table below on their own.  Groups of students can visit local supermarket/grocery stores with mobile  storing devices or carry out a web-search in order to collect the information.  In case mobile devices are not available, they can take paper notes. Since there are so many ingredients  on the table it will be very time consuming to find the information for all  them. There are two alternatives to this problem. Groups of students could look  up the info of different groups of ingredients (e.g. 5-10 ingredients per  group) or the teacher can provide a semi-complete table and have students  complete the missing information. The table will provide students with  an authentic, hands-on activity and can be used in Activity 7 during the  optimization strategy.<br />
