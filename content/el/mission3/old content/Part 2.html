  <strong>________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of  Activity 2:</strong><br />
  In Activity 2 you will be introduced to the five categories  of nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals), their  function and their daily required quantity. In addition, you will learn how to  read and interpret nutritional value labels found on most food products. </p>
<p><strong>General learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>organize, analyze and interpret data.</li>
  <li>collaborate with peers (share tasks/information,  collaborate on experiments, make decision together, etc.).</li>
  <li>write individual reports and assignments.</li>
  <li>perform  simple calculations (e.g. additions and multiplications) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain-specific  learning goals</strong><br />
  In this activity you will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>learn about the definition of each nutrient, its  function and its daily required quantity.</li>
  <li>learn about the nutritional needs of a person  (e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, minerals, vitamins, etc.).</li>
  <li>learn how to read and understand the label of  ingredients on food items.</li>
  <li>learn how to calculate the nutritional value of  a certain quantity of a product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.1: Introduction to  nutrients </strong><br />
  During  the previous activity, you have created a food and exercise diary for a  fictitious character. You have probably selected a large variety of food items  for him or her to eat. But what exactly is in all these food products that your  body needs? Now you will learn that everything you eat or drink contains  different (combinations of) nutrients. In this activity you will learn about  nutrients and their function in the human body. Visit the following Internet  resources and complete the table below:</p>
<p>Internet sources:</p>

  <li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake</li>
</ul>
<p>Please complete the table bellow. Under &ldquo;Nutrients,&rdquo; list  the six nutrient categories (A.-F.). Then, fill in their three main functions (G.-I.)  under &ldquo;Function&rdquo;. Now, complete the remaining of the table by checking (<img width="15" height="12" src="../../../../../Application Data/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5/en_US/OfficeImageTemp/clip_image002.jpg" />) the function of  each nutrient, listing 3 types of foods for each nutrient category and providing  their daily required quantity.</p>

<p><strong>2.2: Labels of  ingredients </strong><br />
  The nutrients of food  - carbohydrates, fat and proteins - provides the human body the energy it needs  to maintain its vital body functions (heart beat regulation, breathing,  digestion, etc.) as well as the energy it needs throughout the day (moving  around, exercising, temperature, etc.). Fat contains almost twice the amount of  energy (calories) compared to carbohydrates or proteins of the same quantity (see  table below). Energy is measured in kilo-calories (kcal) or kilo-Joules (kJ).  One kcal is equal to 1,000 calories or 4.2 kJ. In that perspective, 1 kJ is  equal to 1,000 Joules or 0.24 calories.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>TABLE 3</p>
<p>If the nutrients of a food product (e.g. carbohydrates, fat  and proteins) are known, then the energy (calories) of that product can be  calculated. This corresponds to the total energy of carbohydrates, fat and  proteins contained in a product. Bellow we provide an example for 100mL of  milk. Later on, you will calculate the total caloric intake of your character  from his or her food diary. But first, you are going to practice a little bit  with these calculations.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="590" valign="top"><p>Food provides us with energy, like petrol provides cars with fuel to run    or like coal used in power stations to generate electricity to operate a    factory. We use up energy in whatever activities we do. Physical work, such    as walking, running and exercising, requires energy. Even resting and mental    work, such as thinking, requires energy! Energy is also used in such basic    body processes as the heart beat and digestion in the stomach.<br />
</p>
      <p><a name="measure" id="measure"><em>Measurement of Energy</em></a><br />
        <br />
        Energy is measured in joules or calories. Both units are very small. So    when talking about the energy value of food and the energy output of body    activities, we multiply the values by one thousand (kilo=1000) and refer to    them as kilojoules or kilocalories. A Kilocalorie is often abbreviated to Calorie    (Cal) spelled with a capital C. (A kilocalorie is defined as the heat energy    needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water from 14.5° to 15.5° C).    We usually use a Calorimeter to measure the energy content of food    substances.<br />
        <br />
        For conversions, </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>1 kJ = 0.24 Cal </li>
        <li>1 Cal = 4.2 kJ </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Energy is found in carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates are the    most abundant foods in the world, and fats are the most concentrated and    easily stored fuel. If the body exhausts its available carbohydrates and    fats, it can use proteins directly from the diet or break down its own    protein tissue to make fuel.<br />
        <br />
      Average values of energy-yielding constituents</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>One gram         carbohydrates = 3.75 Calories (16 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram proteins =         4 Calories (17 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram fat = 9 Calories         (37 kJ) </li>
        <li>One gram alcohol = 7         Calories (29 kJ) </li>

<p><strong>2.3:</strong> <strong>Nutrients and energy calculations</strong> <br />
  Use the same method with the example above, to calculate the  energy in the food products bellow based on their nutrients per serving. Use  the energy calculator to carry out your calculations.<br />

<p><strong>2.4: Optional:  Ingredients Table</strong><br />
In the occasion of available time and appropriate equipment  (mobile devices/mobile phones), students can collect the nutritional value  information of the pizza ingredients and complete the table below on their own.  Groups of students can visit local supermarket/grocery stores with mobile  storing devices or carry out a web-search in order to collect the information.  In case mobile devices are not available, they can take paper notes. Since there are so many ingredients  on the table it will be very time consuming to find the information for all  them. There are two alternatives to this problem. Groups of students could look  up the info of different groups of ingredients (e.g. 5-10 ingredients per  group) or the teacher can provide a semi-complete table and have students  complete the missing information. The table will provide students with  an authentic, hands-on activity and can be used in Activity 7 during the  optimization strategy.<br />
