<p><strong>The optimization strategy </strong><br />
  </p>
<p>In the next activity you will study  an example of the optimization strategy, which will help you choose the  healthiest pizza ingredients. The optimization strategy is a method used to  make a decision when more than one option is available. The strategy calls for  a two-step process. During the first step, the parameters of each option are  identified and scored on a common scale, based on their characteristics. During  the second step, all parameters are weighted based on their importance and  multiplied with their scale score. The total score for each option is obtained  by summing up all parameter scores of each option. The best option has the  highest score.</p>
