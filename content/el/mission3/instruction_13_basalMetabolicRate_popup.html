<p><strong>Basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong><br />
  <br />
Your body uses a lot of energy, even  when it is at rest. 
Your heart and lungs are working, your body temperature has to be kept at a constant level, 
and there are many chemical processes going on in all your cells. 
Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you use when doing all these &lsquo;basic&rsquo; things. 
For most people, this accounts for  more than half of the total amount of energy they spend during a day. 
Not surprisingly, the BMR depends on weight and height, age and gender. The BMR is  usually measured in kcal/day.</p>
