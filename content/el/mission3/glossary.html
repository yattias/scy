<p><strong>Glossary</strong><br /></p>
<p><strong>Absorption.</strong> The uptake of  nutrients by the wall of the small and large intestine.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Anus.</strong> Opening of the  rear end of the digestive canal, used to expel faeces (shit). The anus is  controlled by a circular muscle.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Arteriosclerosis: </strong>is  a general term describing the hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or  large arteries.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Basal  metabolic rate (BMR).</strong> The amount of energy you spend when your body is at  rest. This is the energy required for the functioning of your vital organs  (e.g. your heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, etc.).<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Blood pressure:</strong> is  the pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Body  mass index (BMI).</strong> A measure that is often used to estimate a (healthy)  body weight given the height of a person.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Calorie.</strong> The energy in  food is measured in calories or joules. A calorie is defined as the amount of  energy that is needed to increase the temperature of 1 ml of water by 1 ˚C. One  calorie equals 4.2 joule. One kilocalorie (kcal) is one thousand calories.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Calorimeter: </strong>is  a device used for calorimetry, the science of measuring the heat of chemical  reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity. <strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular  diseases.</strong> Diseases that involve the heart and/or the blood vessels.  Atherosclerosis (thickening of the artery wall) is a very common cardiovascular  disease, which may result in a heart attack or stroke. <br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Cholesterol: </strong>It  is an essential structural component of mammalian cell membranes, where it is  required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. Although  cholesterol is an important and necessary molecule for animals, a high level of  serum cholesterol is an indicator for diseases such as heart disease.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Colon</strong><strong>: </strong>is  the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates. It extracts water, salt,  potassium and some fat soluble vitamins from solid wastes before they are  eliminated from the body.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Deep pan pizza: </strong>This  pizza is unique because it is far from the roots of an original Italian pizza.  It does not include thin crusts or delicate toppings, but rather it is made  with a heavy, thick crust and large amounts of cheese, sauce and ingredients.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Disease in  which the regulation of blood sugar concentration is disturbed. An unhealthy  lifestyle (eating too much fat and sugar, in combination with a lack of regular  exercise) may cause diabetes type 2 (a specific type of diabetes).<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Digestive  juices.</strong> Secretions of the organs of the digestive system that break down your  food into nutrients that are small enough to be absorbed by the intestine.  Examples of digestive juices are saliva (produced in the mouth), gastric juice  (produced in the stomach) and pancreatic juice (produced in the pancreas).<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Digestive  system.</strong> The digestive system consists of all the organs that are involved in  digestion (the breakdown of food and the uptake of nutrients). In humans, the  digestive system consists of the mouth, the oesophagus, the stomach, the  duodenum, the liver, the gall bladder, the small intestine, the large  intestine, the rectum and the anus.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Domestic animals: </strong>to  be considered domesticated, a population of animals must have their behavior,  life cycle, or physiology systemically altered as a result of being under human  control for many generations.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Dough: </strong>is a paste made out of  any cereals (grains) or leguminous crops by mixing flour with a small amount of  water and/or other liquid.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Duodenum.</strong> The first  section of the small intestine, directly connected to the stomach. The pancreas  and the gall bladder release their digestive juices in the digestive tract in  the duodenum.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Enzymes.</strong> Special  substances in digestive juices that help to break down large nutrients into  smaller components. Each nutrient is broken down by a another, specific enzyme.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Estimated  energy requirements (EER).</strong> The total amount of energy that your body needs. The  main components of the EER are the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and the energy  that is used for the activities your body undertakes.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Food pyramid: </strong>provides  optimal nutrition guidelines for each food category, per day, using a mnemonic  graphic of a pyramid with vertical dividing lines to represent suggested  percentages of the daily diet for each food group.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Fowl: </strong>is a word for birds in  general but usually refers to birds belonging to one of two biological orders,  namely the game fowl or land fowl and the waterfowl.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Fuel consumption: </strong>a  process that converts chemical potential energy contained  in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work. Overall fuel efficiency may vary  per device.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Gall  bladder.</strong> The gall bladder stores bile, which is produced by the liver. Bile  helps the breakdown of fats in your food.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Grains: </strong>the small, hard,  fruits or seeds of arable crops or the crops bearing these fruits or seeds.<strong> </strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Heart  rate.</strong> The number of heart beats per minute.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Joule.</strong> The energy in  food is measured in joules or calories. One joule equals 0.24 calorie. One  kilojoule (kJ) is one thousand joules.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Large  intestine.</strong> The last section of the digestive canal before the rectum and the anus.  In the large intestine, water is absorbed from the remaining matter in the  digestive tract.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Larynx: </strong>commonly called the <strong>voice box</strong>, is an organ in the  neck of mammals involved in protecting the trachea and sound production. The  larynx houses the vocal folds, which are an essential component of phonation.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Lipids: </strong>are a broad group of  naturally occurring molecules which includes fats, waxes, fat-soluble vitamins  (such as vitamins A, D, E and K), and others. The main biological functions of  lipids include energy storage, as structural components of cell membranes, and  as important signaling molecules.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Liver.</strong> The liver is a  large, brown organ and has many functions. For instance, the liver produces  bile, and detoxifies the blood with nutrients coming from the intestines.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Mouth.</strong> The beginning  of the digestive canal. In the mouth the teeth are used to chew your food. In  addition, saliva is added.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Obesity</strong>. A condition in  which people are overweight to an extent that their health is reduced. People with  a body mass index over 30 kg/m2 are considered obese.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Esophagus.</strong> The first  section of the digestive canal after the mouth. The oesophagus transports  everything you swallow to your stomach.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Pancreas.</strong> The pancreas is  a gland that produces pancreatic juice, which is released in the duodenum.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Peristalsis. </strong>The  rhythmic contraction of muscles of the wall of the digestive tract. Food is  pushed forward through the digestive canal by peristalsis.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Pharynx: </strong>is the part of the throat situated behind the mouth and nasal  cavity. The pharynx is part of the digestive system and also the respiratory  system; it is also important in vocalization.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Prostate: </strong>a compound gland of  the male reproductive system in most mammals.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Rectum.</strong> The last  section of the digestive canal, in which faeces (shit) is temporarily stored.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Small  intestine.</strong> The longest section of the digestive canal, in between the stomach and  the large intestine. In human adults, the small intestine has a length of about  five metres. In the small intestine, nutrients are absorbed and enter the  bloodstream. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Stomach.</strong> A large,  muscular section of the digestive canal. In the stomach, food is churned and  mixed with gastric juice. Gastric juice contains enzymes (to break down  proteins) and acids (to kill bacteria and other micro organisms).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Stuffed crust pizza: </strong>a  style of pizza with a crust usually stuffed with cheese.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Thin crust pizza: </strong>a  style of pizza with a thin and firm crust, enough to have a noticeable crunch.<strong> </strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Unhealthy food: </strong>foods  which are perceived to have little or no nutritional value, or products with  nutritional value but which also have ingredients considered unhealthy when  regularly eaten or unhealthy to consume at all.<strong> </strong><br />
