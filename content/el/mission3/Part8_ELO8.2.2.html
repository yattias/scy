<strong>8.2.2: Pizza taste competition (optional)</strong><br />
If the participating  schools have the suitable equipment and the appropriate building installations,  students can attempt to bake a real pizza, using the ingredients they have  selected. In addition, they can have a competition for the tastiest pizza in  their class or school. If no equipment and/or facilities are available, the  schools could try to contract a local restaurant to bake the studentsâ€™ pizzas.
