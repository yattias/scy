Be Smart: Read your Food Labels Intelligently
When we buy manufactured food, we do not often read the food labels printed on the back of the package. Even if we glance through, we stumble upon seemingly difficult chemical compounds we don't know . Manufacturers may list carbohydrates, sugars and fats in terms we do not understand. So it is hard to tell exactly how many nutrients, especially salt, fats and sugars, you will be ingesting.

Largest to Smallest Amount
The ingredients are always listed in order, from the largest amounts down to the smallest. So if you find sugar among the first few ingredients, you know that there is a lot of sugar in the food.

Sugar
Sugar is not always listed as "sugar", but in some other misleading forms. Here is a list of such terms used.  brown sugar  corn sweetener  corn syrup  dextrose  fructose  fruit juice concentrate  glucose  honey  high fructose corn syrup  lactose  maltose  mannitol  maple syrup  molasses  raw sugar  sorbitol  sucrose  syrup  table sugar

Salt
Salt, too has many other aliases. Just look out for the word sodium and beware! 1
