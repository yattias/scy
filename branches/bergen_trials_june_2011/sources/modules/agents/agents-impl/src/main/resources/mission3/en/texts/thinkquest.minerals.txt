What are Minerals?
Minerals are inorganic mineral nutrients like:      Iron Calcium Sodium Magnesium Iodine

Our bodies cannot make these materials, but require them for structural composition of hard and soft body tissues. When we take in iron or other minerals, we do not take them in in their original solid form, but rather in irons. These mineral nutrients, all of which must be supplied in the diet, are of two classes: the major elements such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, iodine, and potassium; and trace elements such as copper, cobalt, manganese, fluorine, and zinc. We need to eat larger amounts of the major elements, but require only small amounts of the trace elements. Still, we need all the minerals. Minerals are used as building materials in the body, and they participate in body processes. For example, iron is a component in the blood and carries oxygen. Calcium is needed for developing the bones. Phosphorus combines with calcium in the bones and teeth. Zinc is also important in forming enzymes.
