Nutritionally important nâ 3 fatty acids include Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. The human body cannot synthesize nâ 3 fatty acids de novo, but it can form "long chain" 20-carbon nâ 3 fatty acids (like EPA) and 22-carbon nâ 3 fatty acids (like DHA) from the "short chain" eighteen-carbon nâ 3 fatty acid Î±-linolenic acid. The short chain nâ 3 fatty acids are converted to long chain forms (EPA, DHA) with an efficiency of approximately 5%[1][2] in men, and at a greater percentage in women.[3] These conversions occur competitively with nâ 6 fatty acids, which are essential closely related chemical analogues that are derived from linoleic acid. Both the nâ 3 Î±-linolenic acid and nâ 6 linoleic acid must be obtained from food. Synthesis of the longer nâ 3 fatty acids from linolenic acid within the body is competitively slowed by the nâ 6 analogues. Thus accumulation of long-chain nâ 3 fatty acids in tissues is more effective when they are obtained directly from food or when competing amounts of nâ 6 analogs do not greatly exceed the amounts of nâ 3.[citation needed] Omega-3 fatty acid 1

[edit] History
Although omega-3 fatty acids have been known as essential to normal growth and health since the 1930s, awareness of their health benefits has dramatically increased in the past few years.[4] New versions of ethyl esterized omega-3 fatty acids, such as E-EPA and combinations of E-EPA and E-DHA, have drawn attention as highly purified and more effective products than the traditional ones. In the United States, these novel versions are often sold as prescription medications, such as Lovaza. In the European Union, they are available as dietary supplements. The health benefits of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids â Contents DHA and EPA omega-3 â are the best 2

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia known. These benefits were discovered in the 1970s by researchers studying the Greenland Inuit Tribe. The Greenland Inuit people consumed large amounts of fat from seafood, but displayed virtually no cardiovascular disease. The high level of omega-3 fatty acids consumed by the Inuit reduced triglycerides, heart rate, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis.[5] On September 8, 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave "qualified health claim" status to EPA and DHA nâ 3 fatty acids, stating that "supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA [nâ 3] fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."[6] This updated and modified their health risk advice letter of 2001 (see below). Currently, regulatory agencies[who?] do not accept that there is sufficient evidence for any of the suggested benefits of DHA and EPA other than for cardiovascular health, and further claims should be treated with caution. The Canadian Government has recognized the importance of DHA omega-3 and permits the following biological role claim for DHA: "DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, supports the normal development of the brain, eyes and nerves."[7]

[edit] Chemistry

Chemical structure of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential nâ 3 fatty acid, (18:3Î 9c,12c,15c, which means a chain of 18 carbons with 3 double bonds on carbons numbered 9, 12 and 15). Although chemists count from the carbonyl carbon (Blue Numbering), physiologists count from the n (Ï ) carbon (red numbering). Note that from the n end (diagram right), the first double bond appears as the third carbon-carbon bond (line segment), hence the name "nâ 3". This is explained by the fact that the n end is almost never changed during physiologic transformations in the human body, as it is more stable energetically, and other carbohydrates compounds can be synthesized from the other carbonyl end, for example in glycerides, or from double bonds in the middle of the chain.

Chemical structure of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

Chemical structure of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The term nâ 3 (also called Ï â 3 or omega-3) signifies that the first double bond exists as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end (n) of the carbon chain.[citation needed] nâ 3 fatty acids which are important in human nutrition are: Î±-linolenic acid (18:3, nâ 3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, nâ 3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, nâ 3; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5 or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20 or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. All double bonds are in the cis-configuration; in other words, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond. Most naturally-produced fatty acids (created or transformed in animal or plant cells with an even number of carbon in chains) are in cis-configuration. [edit] History 3

[edit] Biological significance
The biological effects of the nâ 3 are largely mediated by their interactions with the nâ acids; see Essential fatty acid interactions for detail. A 1992 article by biochemist William E.M. Lands[12] provides an overview of the research into nâ acids, and is the basis of this section. 6 fatty

3 fatty

The 'essential' fatty acids were given their name when researchers found that they were essential to normal growth in young children and animals. (Note that the modern definition of 'essential' is more strict.) A small amount of nâ 3 in the diet (~1% of total calories) enabled normal growth, and increasing the amount had little to no additional effect on growth. Likewise, researchers found that nâ 6 fatty acids (such as Î³-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) play a similar role in normal growth. However, they also found that nâ 6 was "better" at supporting dermal integrity, renal function, and parturition. These preliminary findings led researchers to concentrate their studies on nâ 6, and it was only in recent decades that nâ 3 has become of interest. In 1964, it was discovered that enzymes found in sheep tissues converted nâ 6 arachidonic acid into the inflammatory agent called prostaglandin E2[13] which both causes the sensation of pain and expedites healing and immune response in traumatized and infected tissues.[citation needed] By 1979, more of what are now known as eicosanoids were discovered: thromboxanes, prostacyclins and the leukotrienes.[citation needed] The eicosanoids, which have important biological functions, typically have a short active lifetime in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. However, if the rate of [edit] Chemistry 4

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess eicosanoids may have deleterious effects[citation needed]. Researchers found that certain nâ 3 fatty acids are also converted into eicosanoids, but at a much slower rate. Eicosanoids made from nâ 3 fatty acids are often referred to as anti-inflammatory, but in fact they are just less inflammatory than those made from nâ 6 fats. If both nâ 3 and nâ 6 fatty acids are present, they will "compete" to be transformed[citation needed], so the ratio of long-chain nâ 3:nâ 6 fatty acids directly affects the type of eicosanoids that are produced[citation needed]. This competition was recognized as important when it was found that thromboxane is a factor in the clumping of platelets, which can both cause death by thrombosis and prevent death by bleeding. The leukotrienes were similarly found to be important in immune/inflammatory-system response, and therefore relevant to arthritis, lupus, asthma, and recovery from infections. These discoveries led to greater interest in finding ways to control the synthesis of nâ 6 eicosanoids. The simplest way would be by consuming more nâ 3 and fewer nâ 6 fatty acids[citation needed]. When administered as the ethyl ester, the omega-3 fatty acid EPA appears to form potent anti-inflammatory molecules, called resolvins and omega-3-oxylipins,[14] which may partly explain the positive effects of fish oil.[citation needed] The n-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA may act as direct ligands to a cell surface G-protein receptor affecting anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitization in mice.[15]

[edit] Conversion efficiency of ALA to EPA and DHA
It has been reported that conversion of ALA to EPA and further to DHA in humans is limited, but varies with individuals.[16] Women have higher ALA conversion efficiency than men, probably due to the lower rate of utilization of dietary ALA for beta-oxidation. This suggests that biological engineering of ALA conversion efficiency is possible. Goyens et al. argue that it is the absolute amount of ALA, rather than the ratio of nâ 3 and nâ 6 fatty acids, which affects the conversion.[17]

[edit] Potential health benefits
The 18 carbon Î±-linolenic acid (ALA) has not been shown to have the same cardiovascular benefits as DHA or EPA.[18] Currently there are many products on the market which claim to contain health promoting "omega 3", but contain only ALA, not EPA or DHA. These products contain mainly plant oils and must be converted by the body to create DHA and are therefore less effective. DHA and EPA are made by microalgae that live in seawater. These are then consumed by fish and accumulate to high levels in their internal organs. The United States Environmental Protection agency issues fish consumption advisories to empower Americans to avoid toxic mercury levels in certain fish and shellfish while still reaping the health benefits of consuming fish and shellfish. [19] People with certain circulatory problems, such as varicose veins, may benefit from such supplements containing EPA and DHA which stimulate blood circulation, increase the breakdown of fibrin, a compound involved in clot and scar formation, and additionally have been shown to reduce blood pressure.[20][21] There is scientific evidence that nâ 3 fatty acids reduce blood triglyceride levels[22][23][24][25] and regular intake may reduce the risk of secondary and primary heart attack.[26][27][28][29] A systematic review of studies prior to 2005 found evidence that ALA does not confer the cardiovascular health benefits of EPA and DHA.[30] Some potential benefits have been reported in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis[31][32] and cardiac arrhythmias.[33][34][35]

[edit] Biological significance

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia There is preliminary evidence that EPA supplementation, either with DPA or medication, is helpful in cases of depression[36][37][38] Therre is also preliminary evidence that supplementation with ALA, EPA, and DHA, alone or in combination with n-6 fatty acids, can reduce anxiety.[39][40] The New York Times,[41] however, reports that at least one study[42] has not found a connection between depression in heart patients taking Sertraline and supplements containing EPA and DHA. Some research suggests that fish oil intake may reduce the risk of ischemic and thrombotic stroke,[43][44][45] although large amounts may actually increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (see below): lower amounts are not related to this risk,[45] 3 grams of total EPA/DHA daily are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) with no increased risk of bleeding involved[46] and many studies used substantially higher doses without major side effects (for example: 4.4 grams EPA/2.2 grams DHA in 2003 study).[36]

[edit] Cancer
Several studies report possible anti-cancer effects of nâ 3 fatty acids (particularly breast, colon, and prostate cancer).[47][48][49] Omega-3 fatty acids reduced prostate tumor growth, slowed histopathological progression, and increased survival.[50] Among n-3 fatty acids [omega-3], neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk. High levels of docosahexaenoic acid, however, the most abundant n-3 PUFA in erythrocyte membranes, were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.[51] A 2006 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that their review of literature covering cohorts from many countries with a wide variety of demographic concluded that there was no link between nâ 3 fatty acids and cancer.[52] This is similar to the findings of a review by the British Medical Journal of studies up to February 2002 that failed to find clear effects of long and shorter chain nâ 3 fats on total mortality, combined cardiovascular events and cancer.[53] A 2007 systematic review of n-3 fatty acids and cachexia found evidence that oral n-3 fatty acid supplements benefit cancer patients, improving appetite, weight and quality of life.[54] A 2009 trial found that a supplement of eicosapentaenoic acid helped cancer patients retain muscle mass.[55]

[edit] Cardiovascular disease
In 1999, the GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators reported in the Lancet, the results of major clinical study in 11,324 patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Treatment 1 gram per day of nâ 3 fatty acids reduced the occurrence of death, cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death by 20%, 30% and 45% respectively.[56] These beneficial effects were seen from three months onwards.[57] In April 2006, a team led by Lee Hooper at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, published a review of almost 100 separate studies of nâ 3 fatty acids found in abundance in oily fish. It concluded that they do not have a significant protective effect against cardiovascular disease.[58] This meta-analysis was controversial and stands in stark contrast with two different reviews also performed in 2006 by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition[59] and a second JAMA review[60] that both indicated decreases in total mortality and cardiovascular incidents (i.e. myocardial infarctions) associated with the regular consumption of fish and fish oil supplements. In the March 2007 edition of the journal Atherosclerosis, 81 Japanese men with unhealthy blood sugar levels were randomly assigned to receive 1800 mg daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with the other half being a control group. The thickness of the carotid arteries and certain measures of blood flow were measured before and after supplementation. This went on for approximately two years. A total of 60 patients (30 in the E-EPA group and 30 in the control group) completed the study. Those given the EPA had a statistically significant decrease in the thickness of the carotid arteries along with improvement in blood flow. The authors indicated [edit] Potential health benefits 6

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that this was the first demonstration that administration of purified EPA improves the thickness of carotid arteries along with improving blood flow in patients with unhealthy blood sugar levels.[61] In a study published in the American Journal of Health System Pharmacy March 2007, patients with high triglycerides and poor coronary artery health were given 4 grams a day of a combination of EPA and DHA along with some monounsaturated fatty acids. Those patients with very unhealthy triglyceride levels (above 500 mg/dl) reduced their triglycerides on average 45% and their VLDL cholesterol by more than 50%. VLDL is a bad type of cholesterol and elevated triglycerides can also be deleterious for cardiovascular health.[62] A study on the benefits of EPA published in The Lancet in March 2007, involved over 18,000 patients with unhealthy cholesterol levels. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1,800 mg a day of E-EPA with a statin drug or a statin drug alone. The trial went on for a total of five years. It was found at the end of the study those patients in the E-EPA group had superior cardiovascular function. Non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced in the E-EPA group. The authors concluded that EPA is a promising treatment for prevention of major coronary events, especially non-fatal coronary events.[63] Similar to those who follow a Mediterranean diet, Arctic-dwelling Inuit - who consume high amounts of nâ 3 fatty acids from fatty fish - also tend to have higher proportions of nâ 3, increased HDL cholesterol and decreased triglycerides (fatty material that circulates in the blood) and less heart disease. Eating walnuts (the ratio of nâ 3 to nâ 6 is circa 1:4 respectively[64]) was reported to lower total cholesterol by 4% relative to controls when people also ate 27% less cholesterol.[65] A study carried out involving 465 women showed serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid is inversely related to the levels of anti-oxidized-LDL antibodies. Oxidative modification of LDL is thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.[66] A study shows that survivors of past myocardial infarctions are less likely to die from an arrhythmic event if they are consuming high levels of n-3.[67] It is possible that these anti-arrhythmic effects are due to n-3 fatty acidâ s ability to increase the fibrillation threshold of the heart tissue.[68] A study shows that n-3 fatty acids have mild anti-hypertensive effects. When subjects consumed n-3 from oily fish on a regular basis, their systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 3.5-5.5 mmHg.[69]

[edit] Immune function
In a study regarding fish oil published in the Journal of Nutrition in April 2007, sixty four healthy Danish infants from nine to twelve months of age received either cow's milk or infant formula alone or with fish oil. It was found that those infants supplemented with fish oil had improvement in immune function maturation with no apparent reduction in immune activation.[70]

[edit] Neurology
Limited evidence suggests that long-chain n-3 fatty acids delay or prevent the progression of certain psychotic disorders in high-risk children and adolescents.[71] The evidence included the observation that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibited reduced levels of both n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the results of a study in which the treatment of high-risk children with a dietary supplement containing both eicosapentaenoate and docosahexaenoate produced a statistically significant (95% confidence, but not 97.5% confidence) decrease in progression to schizophrenia.

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Consumption of ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-EPA) partially countered memory impairment in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease[72] and produced a statistically insignificant decrease in human depression.[73] Fish oil has been shown to have no effect on cognitive performance in older individuals (65 years of age or older) without dementia.[74]

[edit] Inflammation
Although not confirmed as an approved health claim, current research suggests that the antiinflammatory activity of long-chain nâ 3 fatty acids may translate into clinical effects.[75] For example, there is evidence that rheumatoid arthritis sufferers taking long-chain nâ 3 fatty acids from sources such as fish have reduced pain compared to those receiving standard NSAIDs.[76]

[edit] Risks
[edit] Health risks
[edit] Non-cardiac health risks In a letter published October 31, 2000,[77] the United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements noted that known or suspected risks of EPA and DHA consumed in excess of 3 grams per day may include the possibility of: · Increased incidence of bleeding. · Hemorrhagic stroke. · Oxidation of omega-3 fatty acids forming biologically active oxidation products. · Increased levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol or apoproteins associated with LDL cholesterol among diabetics and hyperlipidemics. · Reduced glycemic control among diabetics. Subsequent advice from the FDA and national counterparts have permitted health claims associated with heart health. [edit] Cardiac risk Persons with congestive heart failure, chronic recurrent angina pectoris or evidence that their heart is receiving insufficient blood flow are advised to talk to their doctor before taking nâ 3 fatty acids. There have been concerns if such persons take nâ 3 fatty acids or eating foods that contain them in substantial amounts.[78] In a recent large study, nâ 3 fatty acids on top of standard heart failure therapy produced a small but statistically significant benefit in terms of mortality and hospitalization.[79] In congestive heart failure, cells that are only barely receiving enough blood flow become electrically hyperexcitable. This, in turn, can lead to increased risk of irregular heartbeats, which, in turn, can cause sudden cardiac death. nâ 3 fatty acids seem to stabilize the rhythm of the heart by effectively preventing these hyperexcitable cells from functioning, thereby reducing the likelihood of irregular heartbeats and sudden cardiac death. For most people, this is beneficial and could account for most of the large reduction in the likelihood of sudden cardiac death. Nevertheless, for people with congestive heart failure, the heart is barely pumping blood well enough to keep them alive. In these patients, nâ 3 fatty acids may eliminate enough of these few pumping cells that the heart would no longer be able to pump sufficient blood to live, causing an [edit] Neurology 8

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia increased risk of cardiac death.[78]

[edit] The nâ

6 to nâ

3 ratio

Main article: Essential fatty acid interactions Clinical studies[12][80][81] indicate that the ingested ratio of nâ 6 to nâ 3 (especially linoleic vs alpha-linolenic) fatty acids is important to maintaining cardiovascular health. However, two studies published in 2005 and 2007 found that while nâ 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are extremely beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans, the levels of nâ 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (and therefore the ratios) were insignificant.[82][83] Both nâ 3 and nâ 6 fatty acids are essential, i.e. humans must consume them in the diet. nâ 3 and nâ 6 eighteen-carbon polyunsaturated faty acids compete for the same metabolic enzymes, thus the nâ 6:nâ 3 ratio will significantly influence the ratio of the ensuing eicosanoids (hormones), (e.g. prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes etc.), and will alter the body's metabolic function.[84] Generally, grass-fed animals accumulate more nâ 3 than do grain-fed animals which accumulate relatively more nâ 6. Metabolites of nâ 6 are more inflammatory (esp. arachidonic acid) than those of nâ 3. This necessitates that nâ 3 and nâ 6 be consumed in a balanced proportion; healthy ratios of nâ 6:nâ 3 range from 1:1 to 1:4 (an individual ideally needs more nâ 3 than nâ 6.)[85][86] Studies suggest that the evolutionary human diet, rich in game animals, seafood and other sources of nâ 3, may have provided such a ratio.[87][88] Typical Western diets provide ratios of between 10:1 and 30:1 - i.e., dramatically higher levels of nâ 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.[89] Here are the ratios of nâ 6 to nâ 3 fatty acids in some common vegetable oils: canola 2:1, soybean 7:1, olive 3â 13:1, sunflower (no nâ 3), flax 1:3,[90] cottonseed (almost no nâ 3), peanut (no nâ 3), grapeseed oil (almost no nâ 3) and corn oil 46:1 ratio of nâ 6 to nâ 3.[91]

[edit] Research frontiers
[edit] Developmental differences
Although not supported by current scientific evidence as a primary treatment for ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and other developmental differences,[92][93] omega-3 fatty acids have gained popularity for children with these conditions.[92] A 2004 Internet survey found that 29% of surveyed parents used essential fatty acid supplements to treat children with autistic spectrum disorders.[94] Omega-3 fatty acids offer a promising complementary approach to standard treatments for ADHD and developmental coordination disorder.[93] Fish oils appear to reduce ADHD-related symptoms in some children.[93] Double blind studies have showed "medium to strong treatment effects of omega 3 fatty acids on symptoms of ADHD" after administering amounts around 1 gram for three to six months.[95][96][97] A 2009 survey concluded that there is not enough scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids for autism spectrum disorders.[98] One randomized controlled trial found that omega-3 fatty acids did not significantly affect aberrant behavior in autistic children, and although the investigators noted reduced hyperactivity,[99] their later reanalysis reported that the reduction was not statistically significant.[100]

[edit] Low birth weight
In a study of nearly 9,000 pregnant women, researchers found women who ate fish once a week during their first trimester had 3.6 times less risk of low birth weight and premature birth than those who ate no fish. Low consumption of fish was a strong risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight.[101][102] However, attempts by other groups to reverse this increased risk by encouraging increased pre-natal consumption of fish were unsuccessful.[103]

[edit] Psychiatric disorders
nâ 3 fatty acids are thought by some to have membrane-enhancing capabilities in brain cells. One medical explanation is that nâ 3 fatty acids play a role in the fortification of the myelin sheaths. Not coincidentally, nâ 3 fatty acids comprise approximately eight percent of the average human brain according to Dr. David Horrobin, a pioneer in fatty acid research. Ralph Holman of the University of Minnesota, another major researcher studying essential fatty acids, who gave omega-3 its name, surmised how nâ 3 components are analogous to the human brain by stating that "DHA is structure, EPA is function." A benefit of nâ 3 fatty acids is helping the brain to repair damage by promoting neuronal growth.[58] In a six-month study involving people with schizophrenia and Huntington's disease who were treated with E-EPA or a placebo, the placebo group had clearly lost cerebral tissue, while the patients given the supplements had a significant increase of grey and white matter.[104] In the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain, low brain nâ 3 fatty acids are thought to lower the dopaminergic neurotransmission, possibly contributing to the negative and neurocognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. This reduction in dopamine system function in the PFC may lead to an overactivity in dopaminergic function in the limbic system of the brain which is suppressively controlled by the PFC dopamine system, causing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is called the nâ 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid/dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (Ohara, 2007). This mechanism may explain why nâ 3 supplementation shows effects against both positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Consequently, the past decade of nâ 3 fatty acid research has procured some Western interest in nâ 3 fatty acids as being a legitimate 'brain food.' Still, recent claims that one's intelligence quotient, psychological tests measuring certain cognitive skills, including numerical and verbal reasoning skills, are increased on account of nâ 3 fatty acids consumed by pregnant mothers remain unreliable and controversial. An even more significant focus of research, however, lies in the role of nâ 3 fatty acids as a non-prescription treatment for certain psychiatric and mental diagnoses and has become a topic of much research and speculation. A 2011 report of preliminary research on mice found that omega-3 deficiency was linked to depression and mood disorders.[105] In 1998, Andrew L. Stoll, MD and his colleagues at Harvard University conducted a small double-blind placebo-controlled study in thirty patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Most subjects in this study were already undergoing psychopharmacological treatment (e.g. 12 out of the 30 were taking lithium). Over the course of four months, he gave 15 subjects capsules containing olive oil, and another 15 subjects capsules containing nine grams of pharmaceutical-quality EPA and DHA. The study showed that subjects in the nâ 3 group were less likely to experience a relapse of symptoms in the four months of the study. Moreover, the nâ 3 group experienced significantly more recovery than the placebo group. However, a commentary on the Stoll study notes that the improvement in the nâ 3 group was too small to be clinically significant.[106] Though Stoll believes that the 1999 experiment was not as optimal as it could have been and has accordingly pursued further research, the foundation has been laid for more researchers to explore the theoretical association between absorbed nâ 3 fatty acids and signal transduction inhibition in the brain.[107] [edit] Low birth weight 10

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia "Several epidemiological studies suggest covariation between seafood consumption and rates of mood disorders. Biological marker studies indicate deficits in omegaâ 3 fatty acids in people with depressive disorders, while several treatment studies indicate therapeutic benefits from omega-3 supplementation. A similar contribution of omega-3 fatty acids to coronary artery disease may explain the well-described links between coronary artery disease and depression. Deficits in omega-3 fatty acids have been identified as a contributing factor to mood disorders and offer a potential rational treatment approach."[108] In 2004, a study found that 100 suicide attempt patients on average had significantly lower levels of EPA in their blood as compared to controls.[109] In 2006 the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) stated the following: "The preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p=.02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications." [110] Another meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 2007, based on 10 clinical trials, found that Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly improved depression in patients with both unipolar and bipolar disorder. However, based upon the heterogeneity of the trials, the authors concluded that "more large-scale, well-controlled trials are needed to find out the favorable target subjects, therapeutic dose of EPA and the composition of omega-3 PUFAs in treating depression".[111] A small American trial, published in 2009, concluded that E-EPA, as monotherapy, demonstrated a statistically insignificant advantage over placebo, possibly due to study limitations.[112]

[edit] Dietary sources
[edit] Daily values
As macronutrients, fats are not assigned recommended daily allowances. Macronutrients have AI (acceptable intake) and AMDR (acceptable macronutrient distribution range) instead of RDAs. The AI for nâ 3 is 1.6 grams/day for men and 1.1 grams/day for women[113] while the AMDR is 0.6% to 1.2% of total energy.[114] A growing body of literature suggests that higher intakes of Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may afford some degree of protection against coronary heart disease. Because the physiological potency of EPA and DHA is much greater than that for Î±-linolenic acid, it is not possible to estimate one AMDR for all nâ 3 fatty acids. Approximately 10 percent of the AMDR can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA."[114] There was insufficient evidence as of 2005 to set a UL (upper tolerable limit) for nâ 3 fatty acids.[113] A perceived risk[by whom?] of fish oil nâ 3 supplementation has been heavy metal poisoning by the body's accumulation of traces of heavy metals, in particular mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic and cadmium as well as other contaminants (PCBs, furans, dioxins, PBDEs), which potentially might be found especially in less-refined fish oil supplements. However, in reality, heavy metal toxicity from consuming fish oil [edit] Psychiatric disorders 11

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia supplements is highly unlikely. This is because heavy metals selectively bind with protein in the fish flesh rather than accumulate in the oil. An independent test in 2006 of 44 fish oils on the US market found that all of the products passed safety standards for potential contaminants.[115] The FDA recommends that total dietary intake of nâ 3 fatty acids from fish not exceed 3 grams per day, of which no more than 2 grams per day are from nutritional supplements.[6] Historically, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published acceptable standards regarding contaminants in fish oil. The most stringent current standard is the International Fish Oils Standard (IFOS). Fish oils that typically make this highest grade are those that are molecularly distilled under vacuum, and have virtually no measurable level of contaminants (measured parts per billion and parts per trillion). nâ 3 supplementation in food has been a significant recent trend in food fortification, with global food companies launching nâ 3 fortified bread, mayonnaise, pizza, yogurt, orange juice, children's pasta, milk, eggs, confections and infant formula. The American Heart Association has set up dietary recommendations for n-3 due to its cardiovascular benefits. According to the AHA, individuals with no history of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction should consume oily fish or fish oils two times per week. Those who have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease after infarction should consume 1 g EPA and DHA per day from oily fish or supplements. Individuals who wish to lower blood triglycerides should consume 2-4 g of EPA and DHA per day in the form of supplements.[116]

[edit] Fish
See also: Fish oil The most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is cold water oily fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies and sardines, which they obtain from consumption of algae. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much nâ 3 as nâ 6. Other oily fish such as tuna also contain nâ 3 in somewhat lesser amounts. Consumers of oily fish should be aware of the potential presence of heavy metals and fat-soluble pollutants like PCBs and dioxin, which are known to accumulate up the food chain. After extensive review, researchers from Harvard's School of Public Health reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association (2006) that the benefits of fish intake generally far outweigh the potential risks. As fish oil supplements are bought for their healthful Omega-3 fatty acid content, it is therefore vital that manufacturers and suppliers of these products ensure that they do not contain high levels of dioxins and other toxins.[117] Not all forms of fish oil may be equally digestible. Of four studies that compare bioavailability of the glyceryl ester form of fish oil vs. the ethyl ester form, two have concluded that the natural glyceryl ester form is better, and the other two studies did not find a significant difference. No studies have shown the ethyl ester form to be superior, although it is cheaper to manufacture.[118][119] Although fish is a dietary source of nâ 3 fatty acids, fish do not synthesize them; they obtain them from the algae (microalgae in particular) or plankton in their diet.[120] Grams of nâ 3 per 3oz (85g) serving of popular fish.,[121] [122] grams nâ 3 0.21â 1.1 0.17-0.24 12

[edit] Krill
Krill oil is a newly discovered source of nâ 3 fatty acids. Various claims are made in support of krill oil as a superior source of nâ 3 fatty acids. It was recently demonstrated that the effect of krill oil, at a lower dose of EPA + DHA (62.8%), is similar to that of fish oil[124].

[edit] Green-lipped mussel
Green-lipped mussel from New Zealand also known as Perna canaliculus is another source of n-3 fatty acids. Research suggests that green-lipped mussels contain a distinct blend of n-3 fatty acids in comparison to other sources of n-3s. Most published studies report green-lipped musselsâ health benefits with inflammation. The book The Inflammation Revolution by George Halpern, MD., PhD., professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University discusses the effects of green-lipped mussels in comparison to NSAIDs in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, particularly arthritis.[125] Lyprinol is a patented New Zealand mussel oil extract.[126]

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Six times richer than most fish oils in nâ 3,[130] albeit in the short chain form lacking EPA and DHA, flax (or linseed) (Linum usitatissimum) and its oil are perhaps the most widely available botanical source of nâ 3. Flaxseed oil consists of approximately 55% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Flax, like Salvia hispanica (chia), contains approximately three times as much nâ 3 as nâ 6. However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest reports "the omega-3s that FDA considers healthful (DHA and EPA) are not found in plants such as flax seed [but rather, ALA is]."[131] See Omega 3#Conversion efficiency of ALA to EPA and DHA Purslane contains more Omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid in particular[132]) than any other leafy vegetable plant. Purslane has .01 mg/g of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and this is an extraordinary amount of EPA for vegetable sources.

[edit] Eggs
Eggs produced by chicken fed a diet of greens and insects produce higher levels of nâ 3 fatty acids (mostly ALA) than chicken fed corn or soybeans.[133] In addition to feeding chickens insects and greens, fish oils may be added to their diet to increase the amount of fatty acid concentrations in eggs.[134] The addition of flax and canola seeds to the diet of chickens, both good sources of alpha-linolenic acid, increases the omega-3 content of the eggs.[135] However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest reports that "the omega-3s that FDA considers healthful (DHA and EPA) are not found in plants such as flax seed." It also reports that "Eggs contain too much saturated fat and cholesterol to meet FDAâ s definition of healthy."[131] The addition of green algae or seaweed to the diet boosts the content of DHA and EPA omega-3 content, which are the forms of omega-3 that are approved by the FDA for medical claims. A common consumer complaint is that "Omega-3 eggs can sometimes have a fishy taste if the hens are fed marine oils."[136]

[edit] Meat
The nâ 6 to nâ 3 ratio of grass-fed beef is about 2:1, making it a more useful source of nâ grain-fed beef, which usually has a ratio of 4:1.[137] 3 than

In most countries, commercially available lamb is typically grass-fed, and thus higher in nâ 3 than other grain-fed or grain-finished meat sources. In the United States, lamb is often finished (i.e. fattened before slaughter) with grain, resulting in lower nâ 3.[138] The omega-3 content of chicken meat may be enhanced by increasing the animals' dietary intake of grains that are high in nâ 3, such as flax, chia, and canola.[139] Kangaroo meat is also a source of nâ 3 with fillet and steak containing 74 mg per 100g of raw meat.[140]

[edit] Seal oil
Seal oil is a source of EPA, DPH, and DPA. According to Health Canada, it helps to support the development of the brain, eyes and nerves in children up to 12 years of age.[141] However, like all seal products, it is not allowed for import into the European Union[142]

[edit] Other sources
Milk and cheese from grass-fed cows may also be good sources of nâ 3. One UK study showed that half a pint of milk provides 10% of the recommended daily intake (RDI) of ALA, while a piece of organic cheese the size of a matchbox may[weasel words] provide up to 88%".[143]

Omega-3 fatty acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The microalgae Crypthecodinium cohnii and Schizochytrium are rich sources of DHA (22:6 nâ 3) and can be produced commercially in bioreactors. This is the only source of DHA acceptable to vegans. Oil from brown algae (kelp) is a source of EPA. Persian Walnuts are one of few nuts that contain appreciable nâ 3 fat, with approximately a 1:4 ratio of nâ 3 to nâ 6.[64] Acai palm fruit also contains nâ 3 fatty acids.
