Dietary Reference Intake
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search It has been suggested that Reference Daily Intake be merged into this article or section. (Discuss) The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is a system of nutrition recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The DRI system is used by both the United States and Canada and is intended for the general public and health professionals. Applications include: · Composition of diets for schools, prisons, hospitals or nursing homes · Industries developing new food stuffs · Healthcare policy makers and public health officials The DRI was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing guidelines known as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). The DRI values are not currently used in nutrition labeling, where the older Reference Daily Intakes are still used.

History
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) was developed during World War II by Lydia J. Roberts, Hazel Stiebeling and Helen S. Mitchell, all part of a committee established by the United States National Academy of Sciences in order to investigate issues of nutrition that might "affect national defense" (Nestle, 35).[1] The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for "energy and eight nutrients", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35). The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a Dietary Reference Intake 1

Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account. The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In the early 1950s, United States Department of Agriculture nutritionists made a new set of guidelines that also included the number of servings of each food group in order to make it easier for people to receive their RDAs of each nutrient.

Current recommendations
The current Dietary Reference Intake recommendation is composed of: · Estimated Average Requirements (EAR), expected to satisfy the needs of 50% of the people in that age group based on a review of the scientific literature. · Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board to meet the requirements of nearly all (97â 98%) healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group. It is calculated based on the EAR and is usually approximately 20% higher than the EAR (See "Calculating the RDA", below). · Adequate Intake (AI), where no RDA has been established, but the amount established is somewhat less firmly believed to be adequate for everyone in the demographic group. · Tolerable upper intake levels (UL), to caution against excessive intake of nutrients (like vitamin A) that can be harmful in large amounts. This is the highest level of consumption that current data have shown to be safe. The RDA is used to determine the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) which is printed on food labels in the U.S. and Canada.

Vitamins and minerals
EARs, RDA/AIs and ULs for an average healthy 25-year old male are shown below. EARs shown as "NE" have not yet been established or not yet evaluated. ULs shown as "ND" could not be determined, and it is recommended that intake from these nutrients be from food only, to prevent adverse effects. Amounts and "ND" status for other age and gender groups, pregnant women, lactating women, and breastfeeding infants may be much different.[2] Nutrient Vitamin A Vitamin C Vitamin D[4][5] Vitamin K Vitamin B6 Î±-tocopherol (Vitamin E) Biotin Calcium[4][5] Chloride Chromium History EAR RDA/AI UL Unit Top Sources in Common Measures, USDA[3] 625 900 3000 Âµg turkey, carrot juice, pumpkin 75 90 2000 mg orange juice, grapefruit juice, peaches sockeye salmon, swordfish, rainbow trout (also fortified 400 600 4000 IU foods and beverages) NE 120 ND Âµg kale, collards, spinach 1.1 1.3 100 mg fortified cereals, chickpeas, sockeye salmon 12 NE 800 NE NE 15 30 1000 2300 35 1000 mg fortified cereals, tomato paste, sunflower seeds ND 2500 3600 ND Âµg mg mg Âµg beef liver, egg, salmon[6] fortified cereals, condensed cow's milk, cheese table salt broccoli, turkey ham, grape juice[7] 2

Calculating the RDA
The equations used to calculate the RDA are as follows: "If the standard deviation (SD) of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is symmetrically distributed, the RDA is set at two SDs above the EAR: RDA = EAR + 2 SD(EAR). If data about variability in requirements are insufficient to calculate an SD, a coefficient of variation (CV) for the EAR of 10 percent is assumed, unless available data indicate a greater variation in requirements. If 10 percent is assumed to be the CV, then twice that amount when added to the EAR is defined as equal to the RDA. The resulting equation for the RDA is then RDA = 1.2 Ã EAR. This level of intake statistically represents 97.5 percent of the requirements of the population."[1]

Recent developments
In September 2007, the Institute of Medicine held a workshop entitled â The Development of DRIs 1994â 2004: Lessons Learned and New Challenges.â [9] At that meeting, several speakers stated that the current Dietary Recommended Intakes (DRIâ s) were largely based upon the very lowest rank in the quality of evidence pyramid, that is, opinion, rather than the highest level â randomized controlled clinical trials. Speakers called for a higher standard of evidence to be utilized when making dietary recommendations.
