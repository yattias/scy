<ul>
<li><b>Take an active pose</b>. Meaning that you sit straight, have the interview schema and a pen in front of you, and look the person you are talking to in the eye. 
<li><b>Speak clearly</b>. Among other things, this means you have to talk at an easy pace, speak clearly (but not too loud), and articulate well.
<li><b>Look the respondent in the eye</b>. This shows you are really interested in his/her answer. However, don’t overdo it. Constantly staring at the person sitting in front of you is likely to give him/her an uneasy feeling and limit the chances of getting valuable responses.
<li><b>Listen carefully</b>.
<li><b>Use so-called minimal responses</b>. When the respondent gives a longer answer, give him/her the idea that you are paying attention and are intersted in his/her answer. Varied usage of minimal responses is recommended: saying OK all the time, or “hmm-mm” has an adverse effect as it can be interpreted as obligatory reaction.
<li><b>Evaluate each answer</b>. In particular when respondents answer an open question, make sure the response is relevant and complete. This requires good preparation: you have to know the type of answer you want to get, and can judge the respondent’s reply to this standard. If necessary, ask a follow-up question for clarification or additional information.
</ul>
As a reminder, you could write some of these guidelines at various places in the interview schema.
