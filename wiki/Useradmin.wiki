#summary Developers guide to setup the user management server


How to set up the scy useradmin and run it

*WARNING:* The user admin is a work in progress – so this document will change radically the next coming weeks

Useradmin is built from java1.5 – updates are needed to run it in 1.6, have not had the time yet to fix that part.

Required software:

Java1.5.xx

MySql 4 ++

Maven 2


1.	Check out the code from google code.

2.	There is a file called sample_filter_rename_me.properties. Rename it to filter.properties (in the same folder) and update the properties inside filter.propertes to match your local requirements

3.	In command line in the scyuseradmin folder, run mvn jetty:run to download dependencies and start up a jetty server. This server both serves the web pages of user admin, and also two web services for useradmin and brokerAPI.

4.	You can access the web site from the url: http://localhost:8080/scyadmin/home
For the time being you can only log in with username : scy and password scy, this will be 
updated pretty soon.
